I still know some longhaulers who aggressively follow the research (both real and bullshit) and keep trying to find that one magic answer that will "fix" them. I'm not one of those people. At this point I've read enough about chronic illness to recognize that what I have falls into that class of illness, and the shift has been to one of managing it rather than trying to fully recover from it.</p><p>And when I've tried to describe this attitude to people, what I usually say is something like this:</p><p>Collectively, we tend to view the body in mechanical terms. Like a car: when a car isn't running smoothly, you take it to the mechanic, they can diagnose what's mechanically wrong, and make adjustments or swap out parts to get that car back to smooth running.</p><p>But the body isn't a machine.</p><p>It's an ecosystem.</p><p>And chronically ill bodies are places where the ecosystem has been thrown out of whack, due to pollution or invasive species or catastrophic event or something else. We don't ever expect that these ecosystems will return to their original composition, but we do expect that they will find a new homeostasis.</p><hr><p>So that's how I'd been describing things, to the extent that I was describing them.</p><p>I just finished reading Cal Flyn's book <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/islands-of-abandonment-nature-rebounding-in-the-post-human-landscape-cal-flyn/15606084?ean=9781984878212" title="Islands of Abandonment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Islands of Abandonment: Nature Rebounding in the Post-Human Landscape</a>.</p><p>In it, Flyn recounts stories and travel experiences to abandoned/damaged areas and how those areas rebound.</p><p>Metaphorically appropriate, no?</p><p>At any rate, there's a section in the book talking about ecosystems that have been ravaged by non-native species, what we most commonly call invasive species. I'm just going to quote directly here (p. 222):</p><blockquote><p>That non-native species should be able to settle in--and even come to serve some helpful roles--does throw a little cold water over the idea of the ecosystem as the intricately wrought, carefully balanced product of millennia of coevolution, each species carving its way into the genes of the others' as water sculpts rocks. Indeed, it is the success of aliens like maesopsis, all over the world, that has fed into a bold new perspective, one that seeks to reevaluate environments "tainted" by the proliferation of non-native species.<br><br>Such ecosystems, suggests this new school of thought, are "novel ecosystems"--created by man, but self-sustaining. And it is time to accept the fact that they have changed forever, cannot be returned to a previous "unspoiled" state--indeed, that the notion of their being spoiled in the first place may be incorrect--and appreciate them, for what they are now. It is, write its proponents, "the new ecological world order." They quote Goethe: "[Nature] is ever shaping new forms: what is, has never yet been; what has been, comes not again."</p></blockquote><p>I keep turning this over in my mind, how wedded we are to the idea of taint or destruction of a pristine former state. Where does that idea of pristine nature--or, for that matter, a "healthy" body as the natural default--come from? Are we wedded to the idea of the body as machine because that makes it less terrifying and unpredictable (as nature can be)?</p><hr><p>They're not easy questions to try to unravel, and truthfully today my brain is foggy enough, my energy low enough, that it's futile to ask.</p><p>But there's something here, in that idea of appreciating a novel ecosystem--that something is not spoiled, but merely different from what we expected, but no less complex and no less worthy of appreciation.</p><p>Imagine, for a moment, that an ecosystem has a consciousness. That it's conscious of itself as an entity. (Here, I tend to think of systems I know well--watersheds where I've hiked, areas I've lived. Maybe there's calming water or big sentinel trees or just a vista I know well--picture one that makes sense to you.)</p><p>Imagine what that consciousness experiences when a wildly invasive new species shows up, smothering all the patterns and balances that were there before, throwing everything off-kilter.</p><p>There'd be all the feelings of grief, I suspect. Rage, sadness, denial, depression...so many feelings.</p><p>But ecosystems don't just stop; they keep going. Eventually, that so-called invasive species usually hits a point where the ecosystem can't sustain its insane growth, and the invasive species population semi-collapses--or some other piece of the ecosystem adapts to limit it. From that point onward, that non-native species becomes a part of the ecosystem--sometimes, even, a very integral part of it.</p><p>True, there's a lot potentially lost here: native species that couldn't compete and have been obliterated, maybe entire segments of the ecosystem.</p><p>But I imagine the ecosystem would feel sort of proud, at that point. It might look back on the before times with a bit of sadness, but there would also be pride at having weathered that shit time when everything seemed to be falling apart. Pride at having survived that time, pride in achieving a newer version of itself that is now balanced again rather than giving up. The details won't ever be the same, the balance might be a bit more tenuous and fragile than before, but what an achievement.</p><p>It's not that hard for me to imagine, because quite honestly, this is my life.</p><p>I had an unusual, highly-invasive virus enter the ecosystem of my body, and it threw off a careful balance that had been working pretty darn well my whole life. And for the first couple years, that intruder threw my ecosystem into chaos. Nothing could be expected to work as it did before, even things that seemed like they should have been unaffected somehow were. It felt like there was no way forward.</p><p>Yet, somehow, slowly, some sense of balance has returned. It's nowhere near the balance I had before--it's definitely more fragile. Things work very differently than they did before, and as a consequence, my life and my self are very different. I keep having to try to re-embrace the idea of letting go of the previous version of this ecosystem. Looking at pictures of how strong and stable and well-constructed it once was just makes me long for those "unspoiled" days. (If they ever existed...increasingly, I think the perception of them as unspoiled was itself deeply flawed.)</p><p>But the fact that my ecosystem body has found any path forward--that I'm not still in the throes of the really dark days of 2020 and 2021, that I no longer feel like I'm slipping into dementia and going to run out of air, that my skin isn't erupting in weird hive-like responses to certain stimuli, I have any sense of taste or smell at all, and I don't wake up each day with a fresh hellacious symptom--it's really f*cking amazing, frankly.</p><p>Thanks to the novel coronavirus and the ways it impacted my body, I am now a novel ecosystem.</p><p>In a world where we're coming to grips with the omnipresence of microplastics, forever chemicals like PFAS, Superfund sites, kudzu, pythons, hitchhiking zebra mussels, and climate change, our entire world is becoming a patchwork of novel ecosystems.</p><p>Maybe this just puts me one step ahead of the game in understanding that and still finding a way to get out of bed each day.</p><p>Or maybe it just makes it easier for me to explain what this feels like.😅</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on January 27, 2023</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="http://www.livewithsass.com/tags/longhaulerwithsass/">longhaulerwithsass</a></li></ul>false<div class="post__bio bio"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f5fcd999b9945615c753696fda93bdc?s&#x3D;240" loading="lazy" height="240" width="240" class="bio__avatar" alt="Kate / Sassafras"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="http://www.livewithsass.com/authors/kate/" rel="author">Kate / Sassafras</a></h3><div class="bio__desc">Hi, I'm Kate, trail name Sassafras.
