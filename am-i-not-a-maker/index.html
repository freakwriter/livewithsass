Think of it as a taking stock period before making changes, if you will.</p><p>And one of the things I'm working on is embracing the idea of being a maker.</p><p>Or, to be more specific, on battling some sense of imposter syndrome or unworthiness of the maker title.</p><p>I am a person who makes things. I create written content here and elsewhere, for starters. I also design and build my own furniture. It's nothing fancy, but it is functional and has clean lines. I usually find some kind of design online to use as a starting place or inspiration, and then create my own thing custom-tailored to the space and function I have available.</p><p>I don't have a garage or workshop space, and I don't even own a table saw, so it's quite an ordeal trying to do work on our tiny outside deck when it's not raining, or working up clamps and fences to rip plywood using a circular saw. My lack of a great space or tools likely does impact the quality of what I produce, but I'm still really happy with the stuff I build.</p><p>In the past year, I designed and built a storage shelf/display area for my turntable and LPs, as well as a couch with two chaises. In previous years, I built my own bed frame and one for a friend, my own spice rack and one for a friend, DVD shelves for my partner, and my bedside tables.</p><p>And I've recently started experimenting with making artistic spore prints of mushrooms, to extend one of my hobbies into a thing I can make, too.</p><p>So why, one might ask, haven't I historically identified as a maker? And why am I shifting into using the label at all?</p><p>Good questions, my lovely. Let's take them one at a time.</p><h2>Why I haven't considered myself a maker</h2><p>What feels like a lifetime ago, in my early twenties, I definitely described myself as a writer. I pursued two degrees in writing and a lot of my life was consumed by working on essays, short stories, and poems.</p><p>After I graduated with my M.A., I started adjunct teaching. And slowly, perhaps inexorably, I got so bogged down in the day-to-day of grading papers and preparing lessons and all the rest, I stopped my own writing. I focused on helping my students improve theirs, instead.</p><p>When I got burnt out on writing, I stumbled my way into the tech industry, by way of teaching myself how to design and administer databases. (For those of you fellow database geeks, I figured out third normal form organically and without knowing that's what it was called--relational database architecture just made sense to me.)</p><p>Somewhere in there was when I stopped thinking of myself as a writer, because I wasn't writing anymore and it felt odd to call myself that.</p><p>And despite the fact that I was designing and building databases, I never considered these creative or maker-worthy tasks.</p><p>As my tech career evolved, I started working at a small software company. I worked very closely with software engineers/developers, and that's basically what I've been doing for the last nine years. I've scoped features, done manual testing, written documentation, led webinars and training sessions on things. I've worked closely with devs to make decisions about how best to structure a feature or tweak a user interface.</p><p>But during that time, I always considered what I did as enabling and supporting people who did the "real" work of building the thing. I didn't write code or build features; I just did all the rest of the background work to make that possible.</p><p>Friends and coworkers would build their own websites from scratch, and I always felt somehow less creative or maker-ish because I preferred to use tools or frameworks that did most of the lifting for me.</p><p>At my most recent role, we tried to implement <a href="https://www.eosworldwide.com/what-is-eos" title="What is EOS? Overview of the Entrepreneurial Operating System" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS)</a>. The EOS model depends on a sort of split between a visionary (usually a CEO) and an implementer (usually a COO). It was clear, in every second of those discussions, that I was viewed as an implementer. My job wasn't to dream or come up with ideas; my job was to actually make the ideas a reality.</p><p>Many of those changes came down when I was at my heaviest Long Covid-induced brain fog, and to be fair, IÂ <em>wasn't</em> generating a lot of ideas at that time. It was all I could do just to get through the day and not forget important events, concepts, or what I had started doing fifteen minutes ago.</p><p>Though we ultimately ended up not sticking with EOS, that binary division--and being on the implementer side of it--stuck with me. And it stuck with me long after my Long Covid baseline improved. I started writing this blog, for example. I started working out designs and measurements and building furniture again (which, I must say, is definitely a bit more complicated when you feel like your math skills aren't great anymore and you quadruple-check your math and still sometimes get things wrong!).</p><p>And yet, I still didn't think of myself as being especially creative or a maker.</p><p>So what changed?</p><h2>A tipping point</h2><p>There are few times in my life when I can point to a single crystalline moment where it felt like things changed, but in this case, I can.</p><p>I was having a text conversation with a dear friend, who I'm just going to call D here. At one point, I started talking to her about feeling angsty and like I was "over" software, but that I had no clue what to do instead.</p><p>And she, being the amazing human that she is, asked me some questions about what I enjoyed doing. Then she took it one step further and started dropping prompts into ChatGPT of all things, to get it to suggest ideas and business plans to move forward.</p><p>And many of those prompts had to do with very "maker" things: writing, building furniture, building frames for spore prints and selling them, giving talks on my experiences, etc.</p><p>It might sound silly, but that conversation helped me see myself a bit the way I imagine most of the people who know me DO see me: as a creative person.</p><p>Whether that's creative problem-solving, or writing a talk or blog post, or baking bread, or designing and making things myself, it occurred to me that a lot of the ways I choose to spend my time <em>are</em> creative pursuits, and they are pursuits that involve me making things, in some form or another.</p><p>I don't have to be a web developer to claim that title. I don't have to sell what I do. And I certainly don't have to be the world's most professional furniture builder to do it.</p><h2>Why call it a maker at all?</h2><p>I certainly don't have to have a label to do these things; so why add the label at all?</p><p>Oh, my lovely, I wish this had an easy answer. I'd love to say that I have transcended labels and I don't need them anymore. But the truth is, there's power in calling a thing by its name.</p><p>So much of processing the grief around a chronic illness is processing all the identities it makes you lose. I can't really consider myself an endurance athlete anymore, for example: my body just won't do it. I can't be the hustle and grind gal who travels a ton, either: my body just won't do it. The topology of my day-to-day and month-to-month existence is wildly different.</p><p>Those labels aren't really important, but the sense of self that was underneath them, and losing that, does.</p><p>So many of my posts here are about that grief, or figuring out what it means, and trying to reclaim my sense of self as a result. (See, for example, literally every blog post on here, though especially: <a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/on-resiliency/" title="On resiliency" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On resiliency: Why I ditched the "you'll get better" narrative</a> or <a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/third-times-the-charm/" title="Third time's the charm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Third time's the charm: Sass loses taste and smell yet again</a> or <a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/a-novel-ecosystem/" title="A novel ecosystem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A novel ecosystem</a> or <a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/on-brain-fog/" title="On brain fog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On brain fog: I never had to dream a paper moon</a>, for starters.)</p><p>But a huge part of processing that grief is to find new identities or routines or narratives to push you forward. I don't want to be sitting here constantly lamenting what's gone. I also need to find some good--some hope--in the life I'm living. Living, not just surviving.</p><p>Using the label might also be an act of defiance.</p><p>I defy that Long Covid has destroyed my ability to create things, or to tell meaningful stories. I defy this shitty reality we're all living in that seems to try to strip us of all things joyful. I defy the business and tech worlds that seem bent on painting people like me as implementers rather than creatives.</p><h2>But...what is a maker?</h2><p>Make: has a very short, lovely piece called "<a href="https://makezine.com/article/maker-news/what-is-a-maker-you-are/" title="What Is A Maker? You Are | Make:" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What Is A Maker? You Are</a>". It includes a quotation and a video clip from Adam Savage that resonates with me:</p><blockquote><p>Humans do two things that make us unique from all other animals; we use tools and we tell stories. And when you make something, youâre doing both at once.</p></blockquote><p>It's true that code isn't a tool I'm comfortable with. It's also true that my brain is not as sharp or fast as it was pre-Covid.</p><p>But neither of those things means I'm not a maker. I use tools. I tell stories. Sometimes I use tools to help me tell stories.</p><p>Maybe it's a silly act of defiance to slap a label on that. My homemade couch isn't going to change the world. Not on its own, anyway.</p><p class="dropcap">But if my homemade couch makes me feel creative, autonomous, energized--and if it's also a thing of comfort for my partner and the few people I allow inside my home--then it IS revolutionary.</p><p>It's revolutionary because it's helping me to defy a system of work that tells me I'm just a cog in a machine. Cogs don't think, they don't dream, they certainly don't make things. They're just workers, replaceable bits.</p><p>It's revolutionary because it's helping me to defy a system of consumption that reduces my entire existence down to my purchasing power, that implies that the only avenues I have to change the world are choosing what I buy.</p><p>I'm not a machine. I'm not a cog. And I sure as shit am not just a consumer.</p><p>I'm a human. Perfectly imperfect, struggling to figure myself out. Very human, one might say.</p><p>And because I'm a human, I'm also a maker.</p><p>As you are, my lovely. As we all are.</p><p>We don't have to make things for profit to be makers. We can just make.</p><p>We don't have to make things that will go viral or that will prompt people to pay us as influencers. We can just make.</p><p>For the sheer joy and sense of satisfaction in making something. Anything.</p><p>Use your tools. Tell your story. And tell me about it!</p><p>Â </p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on 20 October 2023</p><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__tag"><h3>Tagged in:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/tags/longhaulerwithsass/">longhaulerwithsass</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livewithsass.com%2Fam-i-not-a-maker%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livewithsass.com%2Fam-i-not-a-maker%2F&amp;via=Live%20with%20Sass&amp;text=Am%20I%20not%20a%20maker%3F" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livewithsass.com%2Fam-i-not-a-maker%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></div></div></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f5fcd999b9945615c753696fda93bdc?s&#x3D;240" loading="lazy" alt="Kate / Sassafras"><div><h3><a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/authors/kate/" class="invert" rel="author">Kate / Sassafras</a></h3><p>Hi, I&#x27;m Kate, trail name Sassafras.
