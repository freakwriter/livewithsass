For most of that time, I've maintained streaks of activity, though before 2019 I didn't really care about the streak. I'd been wanting to learn French for years. Duolingo was easy to fit into my day, even when I traveled a lot for work. And at least once I almost "finished" the French course, only to have a redesign and restructure kick me back down several levels.</p><p>I've had a few times where I got out of the habit. Thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail, for example: I didn't practice French at all then. And I was a bit patchy picking it back up after I finished the trail, until I started using a habit-tracking app that I set to ask me every day if I'd practiced Duolingo.</p><p>In early 2020, I was on a several-months' streak and enjoying the consistency of the habit.</p><p>Then, of course, I got sick with Covid and developed long Covid, with brain fog and fatigue. I already had a 200+ day streak at that point. And although I often could only make it through a review or a single lesson in a day, I clung stubbornly to this routine. I didn't drop my streak, despite being so full of fatigue I couldn't get out of bed and often forgetting English words I used all the time--French was much harder.</p><p>Long Covid took so much from me for so long. I went from being an endurance athlete to, almost overnight, getting winded going up a flight of stairs. My heart rate was all over the place; my steel trap memory suddenly had gaping holes where things used to be. For a while I couldn't even focus enough to read. Duolingo was, in a very real way, one of the only habits that I successfully carried over from the before long Covid (BLC) times.</p><p>I have stuck with it, working my way through every verb tense, learning a bunch of sentences that have no real meaning in real life. Just a couple weeks ago, I finally "finished" the French course (though, of course, thanks to more redesigns, I haven't actually finished unless I hit the Legendary level on all previous levels). I still wouldn't say I can speak French at all. My audio processing is pretty slow, and my speech isn't awesome. I can read it passably well. But I've developed a decent foundation.</p><p>So why, you might be asking, did I give up that 1294-day streak?</p><p>It's a multi-layered answer.</p><p>The first part is that I hate the new UI and format they rolled out a few weeks ago. I was one of those learners who focused singularly on a given skill and worked all the way through it before moving on (which was a boon with my brain fog, since it often took staggering levels of repetition before I could bludgeon my memory to make space for things). The new layout makes that impossible, and it's left me feeling constantly insecure and confused.</p><p>The second part is that I have achieved a chunk of the goal I set out for myself: I got all the way through the course, all levels (ignoring Legendary, which has only existed for a little while).</p><p>But the third part is...harder to articulate.</p><p>Why would I cut this one continuous thread of my BLC brain and life?</p><p>For me, Duolingo was about setting an intention in my life (to rudimentarily learn French) and sticking to that intention. For a long time, that intention made me feel good. I did Duolingo every day (usually in the morning, sometimes at night). I learned things. It was fun.</p><p>Even once I got into some of the trickier verb tenses that were pretty hard to "intuitively" wrap my head around and it felt more like work, it still felt good. My stressed and stretched-thin long Covid brain could still do this thing I used to be able to do. That felt important. It was an act of resistance against this poorly-defined, poorly-understood, untreatable illness.</p><p>But here, starting 2023, coming up quite quickly on my 3rd year anniversary of having long Covid, I find that I want to let go of some of those threads to BLC me.</p><p>There's a lot of grief with chronic illness. Lots of grief and lots of mourning. We lose so much: a sense of stability and predictability, the unexamined presumption of "health" as "normal", all the identities we once had that our bodies make unsustainable. The self basically disintegrates before our eyes and we are left trying to find some way to move forward. Some way to have hope when all of the specific things you once hoped for are no longer possible with the increasingly finite, wildly unpredictable resources your body allows.</p><p>I've been reading Arthur W. Frank's <em>The Wounded Storyteller</em>. Frank identifies a few common narrative models that people with serious illness can follow: restitution, chaos, and quest. And I can see that evolution in my own thinking. I held onto Duolingo for a while because I assumed I'd recover and I didn't want to have lost my streak (restitution). Then I held onto it because everything in my life and my very self was dissolving, crumbling, and was so unpredictable I couldn't find words to describe it (chaos). It was a tiny moment of consistency in an otherwise tumultuous storm.</p><p>But now, starting this year, I'm thinking a lot more about intentionality as it relates to long Covid. In discussing the importance of testimony and recognition with chronic illness, Frank says:</p><blockquote><p>The danger for ill people is that they are often taught how to be ill by professionals. Illness is not presented to the ill as a moral problem; people are not asked, after the shock of diagnosis has dulled sufficiently, what do you wish to <strong>become</strong> in this experience? What story do you wish to tell of yourself? How will you shape your illness, and yourself, in the stories you tell of it? (159)</p></blockquote><p>I can't fully answer these questions yet, though my posts here are one way I'm trying to find my way to those answers.</p><p>What I do know is that I don't want to be clinging to some sense of what used to be normal. Even in the vague way that Duolingo has provided, there is always this subtle feeling of difference between how that experience is<em> now</em> vs. what it was like <em>before</em>.</p><p>I don't want my story to be: here's this thing I used to do really easily and now I'm tenaciously sticking to it even though it's really hard and isn't fun or rewarding at all. That's empty stubbornness, and almost willful clinging to the past.</p><p>Long Covid has taught me how expressly important it is, as a chronically ill person, to be adaptable. To define--and redefine--for yourself what a full life looks like. Because you're the only one who can. You're the only one who understands what feels like a reasonable challenge vs. an unachievable and almost cruel challenge.</p><p>So I would like to redefine this. I'm walking away from Duolingo, but not learning French. My plan is to start trying to read more actual things in French, try to listen to some of the easy French podcasts, and seek out other alternatives that aren't as tidy as an app that tracks my completion but that can give me back some of those feelings of fulfillment and competence I had before. Free from the tyranny of the streak, my hope is that I can structure and pursue learning as it makes sense in my life.</p><p>Resolutions are often about habits. They're about expressing an intention and then committing action to follow through on that intention.</p><p>So my resolution is to let go of this highly structured but no longer purposeful habit and explore alternative habits that help me pick up the melody of the original goal but in a tune that my current body can carry.</p><p>On the Appalachian Trail, there are a lot of places where you can choose to follow side trails--which are often more scenic and are sometimes shorter. The AT is marked with white blazes; the side trails are generally blue. On my thru-hike, I was a religious white blaze follower. It's taken me an extra 4+ years, nerve damage in my feet, and a chronic untreatable illness, but I think I'm finally coming around to the idea of blue-blazing. Because sometimes how you choose to make your way is even more important than the journey itself.</p><p>And if my story here can be useful in any way, I hope that's what you take from it: you always can--and should--walk away from things that aren't serving you or are causing undue stress. You don't have to wield self-control like a mace. Offer your body and your mind a little grace and see what makes your life feel whole rather than full.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.livewithsass.com/media/posts/6/IMG_20180513_082713.jpg" alt="Appalachian Trail sign.
