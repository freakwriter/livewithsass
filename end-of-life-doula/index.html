If you're looking for something in addition to medical care or hospice help as you are near the end of life, a doula like me may be a good fit.</p><h2>Services</h2><p>As a doula, I can help with:</p><ul><li>Providing resources to help dying people and their loved ones process and grieve</li><li>Helping to set up advanced care directives</li><li>Listening and creating space for you to process what's going on, what your wishes are, how you're feeling, and more. A lot comes up for us when the end is near, and we honor ourselves and each other by creating and holding the space to share whatever comes up.</li><li>Helping with plans for the death, funeral arrangements, and so forth</li><li>Remembrance or legacy projects to help a dying person and/or their loved ones find meaning in their lives</li><li>Guided imagery or meditation to help manage pain and anxiety</li><li>Determining appropriate rituals or practices for visiting/attending the dying person</li><li>Helping dying people and their loved ones understand what the process looks like</li><li>Serving as a non-clinical presence and advocate for the dying person</li><li>Making sure a dying person's rituals or wishes are identified and communicated--whether that's what they want to happen before death or after it</li><li>Planning/discussion of what a dying person and their loved ones want to happen when death is imminent, when death occurs, and afterwards</li><li>Ensuring that those plans/discussion actually happen when the time comes</li><li>After death, one or two reprocessing sessions to help loved ones begin to process the experience. I'm not a grief counselor, but these sessions serve as a good starting place and I can refer you to trained grief counselors in our area.</li></ul><p>In short, I can help provide resources and set expectations to remove a lot of the logistics and uncertainty from the process, while also being a dedicated advocate and listening ear as you transition out of this life.</p><p>What I am not:</p><ul><li>A trained clinical professional, such as a nurse, aide, or doctor. I don't provide direct medical care.</li><li>A therapist or grief counselor</li><li>A substitute for medical care, hospice care, hospice facilities, etc.</li></ul><h2>The process</h2><p>I generally try to offer my services as a package, so we can discuss what your needs are, what you can afford, and come up with a service plan that works for you.</p><h2>Where I work</h2><p>I currently live in Harpswell, Maine, and in-person I serve communities within a 45-minute drive of my home, including Brunswick, Topsham, West Bath, Bath, Woolwich, Phippsburg, Durham, Freeport, Gardiner, and Augusta. If you're not sure if I cover your area, just ask!</p><p>I'm also available for virtual sessions to a much wider area, if you're comfortable with those sessions and not having me physically present.</p><h2>How to begin</h2><p>If what you've read above sounds interesting, <a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/contact-me/" title="Contact me">let's talk</a> for a 15-30 minute, no-charge discovery call or meeting to see if I'm a good fit to accompany you through your dying process.Â </p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on 12 January 2024</p><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livewithsass.com%2Fend-of-life-doula%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livewithsass.com%2Fend-of-life-doula%2F&amp;via=Live%20with%20Sass&amp;text=End-of-Life%20Doula" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livewithsass.com%2Fend-of-life-doula%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></div></div></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f5fcd999b9945615c753696fda93bdc?s&#x3D;240" loading="lazy" alt="Kate / Sassafras"><div><h3><a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/authors/kate/" class="invert" rel="author">Kate / Sassafras</a></h3><p>Hi, I&#x27;m Kate, trail name Sassafras.
