                <p>I first learned about the term "pacing" from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/01/16/long-covid-fatigue-pacing/" title="For long covid fatigue, a strategy called 'pacing' helps, but at a cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Washington Post article on using it as a strategy to help with Long Covid fatigue</a>. It gave me a word to describe something I'd intuitively been doing already, and that word allowed me to get more information on how to do it more formally.</p>
<p>First, to start: no, it's not this kind of pacing:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2uwZ4xi75JhxZYeyQB/giphy.gif" alt="Looney Tunes gif of Sylvester pacing back and forth" width="480" height="360" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Pacing within the context of chronic fatigue is more like the adage to "Pace yourself; it's a marathon, not a sprint." It's about spacing out your activities during the day or week so that you don't push your body too far (which can cause symptom flares or crashes).</p>
<p>At its core, it's about alternating between periods of activity and periods of rest--whether that's within a single day or across multiple days--and splitting tasks into smaller chunks so that they take less energy.</p>
<p>Pacing with a chronic illness isn't just a marathon; it's like waking up each day and having to run anywhere from a 5k to a 50k, with no rest days, no way to opt out, and very little input in the distance or terrain type you have to clear. Your body is both the race course and the equipment, and sometimes it will turn on itself.</p>
<p>I have a love-hate relationship with pacing. On the one hand, when I do it well, my quality of life and my daily baseline is way better. On the other hand, there are days when I wish I could just throw it out the window and do whatever I feel like. (I do, sometimes...and pay the consequence later.)</p>
<p>Here are four strategies for increasing your success with Long Covid (LC) pacing:</p>
<h2>1: Mind your energy</h2>
<p>One of the things it was hardest for me to wrap my head around in the beginning is that pacing is about energy usage <em>that is not necessarily physical</em>. As a former endurance athlete and thru-hiker, I was used to pushing my body hard and using a lot of physical energy--and then having to recover from that.</p>
<p>But I was far less familiar with the ways that <em>mental energy</em> and <em>emotional energy</em> could be depleting. In fact, these two forms of energy are <strong>far more</strong> draining for me than physical exertion.</p>
<p>I use the Visible: Long Covid &amp; ME/CFS app (available through the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makevisible.visible" title="Visible: Long Covid &amp; ME/CFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/visible-long-covid-me-cfs/id1624474919" title="Visible: Long Covid &amp; ME/CFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple App Store</a>) to track my symptoms and energy use. The app gives me an option to rank my emotional, mental, and physical exertion (None, A little, Somewhat, A lot).</p>
<p>It wasn't until I started using this app that I really consciously thought about mental and emotional exertion in the same class as physical. That little prompt at the end of each day has helped me become a lot more aware of where and how I'm using my energy. Whether you use the app or not, consider tracking your exertion on all three fronts to help manage LC.</p>
<p>For me, the most stressful forms of energy use are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prolonged periods of focus or concentration</strong>: These have gotten easier for me in the last year, but only with things that I want to be focused on. If it's something I'm not interested in or don't want to do, the energy it takes to focus is downright debilitating.</li>
<li><strong>Long or repeated conversations</strong>: I currently work 100% remotely, but the days where I have meetings tend to drain me. Over an hour of meetings completely destroys my energy for the rest of the day. Longer phone and in-person conversations are also draining, though phone is less so, probably because I'm not having to visually focus on anything while I talk.</li>
<li><strong>Emotional stress</strong>: This is the single most draining activity I can do. If I get upset about something enough to cry, for example, the next day is almost always guaranteed to be a crash. It's a similar response if I get angry or upset.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is one of the weird mixed blessings/curses of LC: you become far more aware of the ways that you use energy, and if you work at pacing at all, you also become far more intentional and deliberate about how you spend your energy.</p>
<h2>2: Redefine rest</h2>
<p>Before I got LC, "rest" often included things like reading, listening to music, playing an instrument, or watching a movie.</p>
<p>With LC, many of these tasks are no longer especially restful to me. Most of them require a level of concentration that can be quite taxing.</p>
<p>For me, rest has evolved to be things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sitting and staring out the window</li>
<li>Really simple craft activities, like drawing or coloring</li>
<li>Listening to certain kinds of music (lo-fi, thank you for existing!)</li>
<li>Reading certain kinds of things: My monthly community paper and airport-style books like murder mysteries or YA fiction are restful; nonfiction or more serious literary fiction is not</li>
<li>Sitting and sipping a hot beverage and doing nothing else</li>
<li>Watching very specific YouTube content that either doesn't involve anyone talking or involves voices I find soothing</li>
<li>Guided meditation or visualization exercises</li>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Breathwork, especially box breathing</li>
<li>Silence. Just...silence: I could sit and stare at the wall and as long as it's quiet, I would find it restful.</li>
<li>Massages: I have a great massage therapist who I see about once a month now. That time/space is quite sacred (and she treats it as such, too, which helps!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Find what actually feels restful for you and try to integrate that in to periods of your day.</p>
<h2>3: Divide to conquer</h2>
<p>One of the big quality of life changes I've made is that I used to tackle a project in one or two long, focused sessions. And I use the term project here fairly loosely. It can include things like cleaning or a little building project or, for example, putting up holiday decorations.</p>
<p>As part of pacing, I generally do not even attempt to complete a project in a single long session. I break it into much smaller pieces and do it that way. This generally allows me to still get the project completed while not causing me to lose entire days to a crash from overdoing it.</p>
<p>Here are a couple examples of what that looks like for me:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cleaning</strong>: Aside from things that have to be done regularly (like dishes, or laundry), my cleaning gets spread out over several weekends. One weekend, I might sweep and mop the floors. Another weekend, I might clean my bathroom. Another weekend, I might tidy my bedroom. Doing all of this in one day would definitely cause a crash. Splitting it up generally allows me to avoid crashes.</li>
<li><strong>Building</strong>: I like to design and build furniture. In the past, I would design and purchase supplies on one day, and then spend the next 1-2 days cutting, assembling, sanding, and finishing a project. Now, I design over the course of a few days. I purchase supplies on a separate day. I do all my preliminary measuring and cutting in one or two sessions on another day. Assembling might be spread out over multiple days, as will sanding and other finishing work. This can mean a project that would have taken me a single weekend before can take me over a month of weekends now.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the beginning, this was wildly frustrating to me.</p>
<p>As time has gone by, I've realized that this form of tackling things both works much better for me, but also allows me to maintain a better level of focus at each stage of the game. I'm not rushing through anything, and it's often very deliberate. (And I am definitely more of a measure twice and cut once person now than I was before!)</p>
<p>The cadence of my life is very different now. The pressure of a deadline will often prompt me to throw all ideas of pacing out the window, much to my own detriment. So I've had to remove deadlines for my own things as much as possible, and I take on fewer commitments for others that involve hard deadlines, unless they're so far out in the future that I can still break things down and tackle them bit by bit.</p>
<h2>4: Scale it down a bit</h2>
<p>Eddie Izzard's fantastic Dress to Kill stand-up has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGGeLHnDQk8" title="Eddie Izzard - Career Adviser &amp; Smoking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this short segment</a> where he talks about meeting with the career advisor as a kid. The career advisor asks him what he wants to be and he says he wants to be an astronaut. And the advisor responds: "Well, you're British, so scale it down a bit." This repeats a couple times as Izzard gradually picks less and less challenging careers.</p>
<p>This is basically my advice for learning how to pace with LC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, you have Long Covid, so scale it down a bit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you first start out trying to pace, take whatever you think you can do in a day. Now remove 50% of what you thought you could do. Try that. (You may have to go even lower, depending on how severe your symptoms are.)</p>
<p>You can keep playing around until you find a percentage that works. Do that until you start to reset the internal barometer of what feels "doable" in a day. (And if you get overenthusiastic in your pacing in the future, repeat this.)</p>
<h2>Two flavors of pacing "failure"</h2>
<p>In listening to other longhaulers and observing myself, it feels like there are generally two ways we might "fail" at pacing:</p>
<ol>
<li>By doing too much on our "good" days, causing a precipitous crash in the following day(s).</li>
<li>By doing too much on our "bad" days, whether to distract ourselves from what's going on or because we have no choice, therefore causing a prolonged crash.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have been guilty of both.</p>
<p>In my first couple years with LC, the first one was more common: any time I had a good day, I would try to do the amount or intensity of things I did when I was "healthy", which inevitably caused a crash like a rubberband being overstretched and snapping back.</p>
<p>In the last year and a half, I fall more into the second camp. I have a better intuitive understanding of how far I can push myself on good days and what the resulting crash will feel like (and how to manage that).</p>
<p>But when I'm having a bad day, I often don't have the luxury of doing nothing. Or I do things because they help distract me from how bad of a day I'm having. I can't quite express this well--it's as if I take this attitude of "well, since I can't do the stuff I want to do, I don't just want to lie here in a state of misery, so how I about I do this one small thing and then I'll rest" which leads to ten small things.</p>
<p>This raises one final important point: your pacing, like your LC symptoms, will be highly individualistic. There's some great general guidance out there, but at the end of the day, it's still about trial and error with your body and your mind to find what works for you. My pacing may look nothing like yours, but if it works for your body, it's right for you.</p>
<h2>Additional resources</h2>
<p>There are a lot of good resources on pacing out there, most of which you can find by searching for "chronic illness pacing". (I suggest chronic illness since there's a lot more resources on pacing for ME/CFS or generic chronic illness than LC specifically.)</p>
<p>A few that I've found useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Toni Bernhard's blog post on Psychology Today (though it's 7 years old at this point, the tips are still relevant): <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/turning-straw-gold/201606/pacing-the-chronically-ill-person-s-best-friend" title="Pacing: The Chronically Ill Person's Best Friend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pacing: The Chronically Ill Person's Best Friend</a></li>
<li>The Ehlers-Danlos Support UK's guide to <a href="https://ehlers-danlos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pacing-for-people-with-me-booklet.pdf" title="Pacing for people with M.E." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pacing for people with M.E.</a> This is geared toward those with ME/CFS, but most of the insights hold true for those with Long Covid fatigue, too.</li>

                <p>As I am more willing to be vulnerable and share my story with others, I find that folks have questions about Long Covid (LC). These sometimes range from things like "How do I support someone in my life who has Long Covid?" to "I think I have Long Covid. What do I do?"</p>
<p>I'm not a medical expert, nor a therapist, nor a grief counselor. But I have had this lived experience since March of 2020, so I'm just going to share things I've learned. If you found your way here in search of treatments or suggestions, consult a doctor or other medical professional before making any changes. Most importantly: Long Covid can vary wildly from individual to individual, so what works for me might actually make your symptoms worse.</p>
<h2>What is Long Covid?</h2>
<p>Long Covid is known by a few different names, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long haul Covid</li>
<li>Post-Covid Conditions (PCC)</li>
<li>Post-Acute COVID-19</li>
<li>Chronic COVID</li>
<li>Post-acute Sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection (PASC)</li>
</ul>
<p>There's no hard diagnostic criteria for it and no test to determine if you have Long Covid (LC). It's not a single illness, but can be a new, returning, or ongoing health problem experienced after being infected with COVID-19. To qualify as LC these days, the symptoms need to exist more than 4 weeks after your infection. There is also no full scientific consensus on what causes LC symptoms. And the range of symptoms is staggering--there are several different "flavors" of LC (generally identified by common clusters of symptoms), but most two people with LC will have some overlap and some differences in what they have. In some cases, LC seems to stem from or cause autoimmune conditions, and while some of those conditions have treatments, there is no known treatment or cure for LC.</p>
<p>So just to sum up: there is no test to determine if you have it, no single verified reason why you get it, and paltry little to do to treat it.</p>
<p>I don't say all of this to bum you out, but just to note that this is a field where a lot of studies and research are currently happening, and while there are a lot of headlines of maybe-promising things, there's very little for a patient to definitively hold on to in the land of "feeling better."</p>
<p>In the US, the CDC provides <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html" title="Long COVID or Post-COVID Conditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a summary (rather than comprehensive) list of commonly reported symptoms</a>, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tiredness or fatigue that interferes with daily life (Me!)</li>
<li>Symptoms that get worse after physical or mental effort, aka post-exertional malaise (Me!)</li>
<li>Fever (Me in the first year, rarely now)</li>
<li>Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath (Me, off and on)</li>
<li>Cough (Me, mainly year 1)</li>
<li>Chest pain</li>
<li>Fast-beating or pounding heart (Me, at various points, thankfully not often anymore)</li>
<li>Difficulty thinking or concentrating, aka "brain fog" (Me!)</li>
<li>Headache (Rarely me, but a lot in the first year)</li>
<li>Sleep problems (Me!)</li>
<li>Dizziness when you stand up (I've always had this at random moments, so...me, but probably not from LC)</li>
<li>Pins-and-needles feelings</li>
<li>Change in smell or taste (Me! I lost my sense of smell and taste almost completely for a year, and when I regained it, it was about 50% what it was before, and I still struggle in the winter)</li>
<li>Depression or anxiety</li>
<li>Diarrhea (Me, after my second Covid infection. Wasn't part of my initial experience)</li>
<li>Stomach pain (Ditto on the second Covid infection)</li>
<li>Joint or muscle pain (Me, mostly in the first year)</li>
<li>Rash (Me x 2!)</li>
<li>Changes in menstrual cycles (Me!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Making all these symptoms even more delightful is that, for many longhaulers, all known tests will say that you are perfectly healthy. I've had a barrage of routine blood tests, heart and lung tests, a brain MRI to evaluate me for stroke, and a cardiopulmonary stress test. All came back as "perfectly healthy" despite the fact that when I had many of them done, I struggled to get out of bed, had no sense of smell, and could barely cognitively function.</p>
<h2>How I manage my Long Covid</h2>
<p>Just to reiterate my disclaimer from above: None of what I'm sharing here is a suggestion that others do what I do. Long Covid is highly individualistic and what works for me might make someone else's symptoms worse.</p>
<h3>1: Track your data</h3>
<p>No, not like some kind of biohacking bro, but for real: track your data. This is especially helpful if medical tests aren't giving you any kind of concrete answers. The only way to determine if changes you make have a positive or negative impact on your symptoms--which is essential to managing a chronic illness--is to track a baseline and then track what happens when you add or remove things from your life.</p>
<p>My own data tracking has gone through two distinct phases:</p>
<h4>Phase 1: Food + hydration + symptoms journal</h4>
<p>Back in 2020, this was my first attempt at trying to understand what my body was doing. At that time, there was even less understanding of LC than we have now. (Heck, my doctor's office was completely closed for the first almost two months of my symptoms.)</p>
<p>I woke up every day with different symptoms; I called it symptom roulette. So the lack of medical guidance plus the feeling like my body was totally out of control led me to start a journal to try to make sense of what was going on.</p>
<p>What I tracked evolved and changed over time, and I had to find things that worked for me. But what I mainly tracked boiled down a few key things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A list of symptoms.</strong> I usually logged these in the morning and then just reviewed to add anything new over the course of the day.</li>
<li><strong>Energy score.</strong> I made this up, and it was my way of trying to rate how much energy I had on any given day, since overwhelming fatigue has been a dominant symptom for me. I used a 1-10 scale, where 1 was nearly comatose and 10 was Energizer Bunny. In my first year of LC, I don't think I ever got above a 5.</li>
<li><strong>Food journal.</strong> I wrote down every food I ate, every supplement or vitamin I tried, and every non-water beverage I drank. Not for tracking calories or macronutrients, but just to try to detect patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Hydration journal.</strong> I tracked the amount of water I drank and, if I took electrolyte supplements, what I took.</li>
<li><strong>Weight.</strong> I don't track this anymore, but in the early days, my symptoms were worse on days where my weight fluctuated up, so it felt like a helpful proxy marker.</li>
<li><strong>Activity. </strong>I tracked what physical activity I engaged in each day. In the beginning, this was quite minimal due to extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, and racing heartbeat. Over time, I was able to do more, though I'm still nowhere near where I was before I got sick.</li>
</ul>
<p>This journaling helped me in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perspective.</strong> It was very easy, especially with brain fog and memory problems, to think that every day totally sucked. Having the journal and looking through it helped remind me on those 2 energy days that I'd had a 5 or a 6 a couple weeks ago, and that I could therefore hope to get back to a 5 or a 6 within a couple weeks.</li>
<li><strong>Patterns &amp; problem-solving.</strong> The combination of all of those symptoms helped me identify some patterns that had a significant positive impact on my quality of life. Some examples:
<ul>
<li>I always broke out in hive-like rashes within 24-48 hours after eating chicken (but not eggs). I quit eating chicken and have had very few of those outbreaks since.</li>
<li>My face broke out in a rash after having beer or hard cider. I quit alcohol for a year and that helped, and then was able to slowly test and reintroduce certain kinds of alcohol in moderation.</li>
<li>I noticed that my fatigue levels were noticeably higher when I a) didn't hydrate enough or take electrolytes, and b) didn't get any prolonged physical movement for 2+ days in a row. These insights have changed how I hydrate and kept me moving even on days where I didn't have the energy to walk my dog--because I knew that the movement, weirdly, seemed to help me feel less tired.</li>
<li>I realized that my cognitive issues were getting worse and worse, which prompted me to reach out to my doctor, who evaluated me for stroke and did a brain MRI. I got a neurologist consult out of this, but ultimately ended up cancelling it because by the time I made it through the waitlist, my cognitive issues had improved significantly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Scientific method.</strong> Tracking all the things meant that when I read a study suggesting using a particular supplement or trying a behavioral change, if I tried it, I could track how my body did after making the change. This tied in with the patterns &amp; problem-solving element; I was able to science my own body a bit to eke out small and then larger gains. Some examples:
<ul>
<li>In the first year of LC, I often ran a fever of 100F (once for 40 days straight). I was able to break this streak by adding in a daily Vitamin C dose.</li>
<li>A friend suggested Reishi tincture to help modulate my immune system. I took it thinking it might help my shortness of breath. It didn't have much impact on that, but it did seem to help with the fevers and kept my rashes calmer, so I continued taking it for about a year until those symptoms disappeared or became more manageable.</li>
<li>I tried Vitamin D3 for months to help with cognitive things. I hadn't been doing the best symptom tracking when I began it, and at some point I ran out and decided I wouldn't get more. Three days into that, I realized that my brain fog and cognitive symptoms were noticeably worse--so I went back on it.</li>
<li>I read about scent therapy and got a variety of essential oils to try to retrain my brain to smell. Thanks to symptom tracking, I could tell that this really didn't do anything for me, so I stopped doing it.</li>
<li>I discovered that high-aerobic exercise was the worst trigger for my post-exertional malaise, so I was able to focus on less intensive workouts that still gave me movement and helped me connect to my body: walking, Qigong, yoga, breathwork, etc.</li>
<li>After years on birth control for ovarian cysts and uterine fibroids, I consulted with my doctors and decided to try coming off of the birth control to see if it impacted my symptoms one way or the other. I'm now a year out from that decision and this has been my best year with LC--it does seem like I have slightly more energy off it than on it (which is counter to a lot of women's experiences with LC, go figure!).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The journal was how I got through the first year of LC. I hand-wrote it in composition notebooks and used a visual layout that helped me remember to add the same things every day.</p>
<p>I largely stopped doing it after I got Covid a second time and was put on Paxlovid--that experience significantly helped a good chunk of my symptoms and I stopped being able to find any new patterns or gains.</p>
<h4>Phase 2: Visible app</h4>
<p>Another student in a class I took learned I had fatigue issues as part of LC and reached out to me privately in 2022 to say she had Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and had found an app that measured heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and did symptom tracking to be useful.</p>
<p>I decided to give it a try after reading some of the information on how HR and HRV seem to correlate with fatigue levels.</p>
<p>The app is called Visible: Long Covid &amp; ME/CFS (available through the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makevisible.visible" title="Visible: Long Covid &amp; ME/CFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/visible-long-covid-me-cfs/id1624474919" title="Visible: Long Covid &amp; ME/CFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple App Store</a>).</p>
<p>It includes a range of symptoms I was already tracking, and you can add or remove them over time. In the morning, you use the flash/camera on your phone to track your HR and HRV in the morning and log your sleep quality, and at night you log the rest of your symptoms.</p>
<p>I've been using it for about a year now, and it has proven remarkably effective at telling me each morning how rough my day is going to be, energy-wise. It uses a baseline for your HR, HRV, and the symptoms you choose to track to give you a pacing score of 1 to 5. (I assume it goes to 5...I have only ever gotten as high as 4!). It's been pretty accurate and this is one more tool I use to figure out when it's okay to push myself and when not to.</p>
<p>It's free to use in the above format. They recently added Visible Plus, a paid subscription feature that includes a wearable heart rate armband; I just started using the armband, so I can't say if that additional cost is worthwhile yet.</p>
<p>But the app has been solid enough and easy enough to use--and my symptoms have stabilized enough overall--so that I no longer do the more detailed journal.</p>
<h3>2: Reprioritize</h3>
<p>I've had to brutally, painfully reprioritize my life. Many of the things I used to spend the most time doing (such as working out--I once was a triathlete and a thru-hiker, after all!) are no longer options in the body I have. And I often don't have the energy to do all kinds of things I'd like to do, whether it's driving more than an hour away or hanging out with friends.</p>
<p>If, like me, you were an otherwise healthy and active person before you got LC, you'll probably have to go through this, too. One of the concepts that might be new to you is that of spoon theory. Here's a quick intro, but there are lots of descriptions and resources out there:</p>
<p class="align-center"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7_9Nis6JqLo?si=YlVts-38S-GDk-hD" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>That energy rating in my journal and my 1-5 score from Visible both serve as a measure of my spoons. On days where I feel like I have fewer spoons, I adjust my day as much as I can to accommodate that. (And try to do more on the days where I have more.) Spoon theory is a workable concept and an easier way to explain to loved ones how you're struggling. My partner and many close friends will now ask me if I have spoons to do x or talk about y now, which is AMAZING.</p>
<h3>3. Learn to pace</h3>
<p>In the chronic fatigue world, there is a concept of "pacing" yourself: identifying the activities that tax your body the most, splitting things into smaller pieces and finding a balance between rest and activity. Pacing ties in a lot with the two previous points: LC bodies tend to have an ebb and flow to energy, and once you've been able to track your data and science/problem-solve to get something resembling a stable baseline, pacing becomes how you maintain that baseline or slowly improve it.</p>
<p>The Visible app has gone a long way to making this a conscious, deliberate practice for me. I also use a habit tracker and added "Did you rest today?" as a habit I explicitly track--when I have a couple days where I didn't feel like I rested, I carve out more time to give my body a break.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/on-pacing.html" title="On pacing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On pacing</a> for a far more detailed breakdown of pacing strategies.</p>
<h3>4: Grieve</h3>
<p>LC can surface A LOT of grief, grief that is mostly going to be unresolved. Many of us lose the ability to be active, or to think clearly. Many of us can no longer do the same jobs we did before, or work at all--some even qualify for disability. We more than anyone have a life <em>before</em> Covid and a life <em>after</em> Covid, and they are starkly different things. (Many of my posts here are basically my attempts to grieve those changes, to try to get to a place of acceptance.)</p>
<p>A lot of us are familiar with Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's Five Stages of Grief. In 2015, Jennifer Martin, PsyD, proposed a <a href="https://www.painnewsnetwork.org/stories/2015/9/13/the-7-psychological-stages-of-chronic-pain-illness" title="The 7 Psychological Stages of Chronic Pain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seven-Stage model</a> for those with chronic illness, which includes stages like "Loss of Self and Confusion" and "Re-evaluation of Life, Roles and Goals". All of which is to say: there's a lot of grief here, and it's different from grieving the loss of another person, because here, you're grieving the loss of your self, or parts of your self.</p>
<p>This one's harder for me to talk about because it feels like no matter how much progress I make at trying to accept where I'm at, I *still* carry the grief of losing a lot of my life. It can be hard, for example, to look at pictures from when I was competing in triathlons or thru-hiking and to reconcile those with a body that considers running errands after working five hours to be "too much".</p>
<p>It's also the one that seems to be hardest for others to offer support on, because many people in your life will stay firmly stuck in denial that you are forever changed. They want you to be healthy and "back to normal" and often won't be open to discussing the grief that comes with this diagnosis.</p>
<p>But carving out space to acknowledge this grief and sit with it is important. Find things that work for you and do them. For me, that's been writing, meditation (especially tonglen), trying to find new hobbies that aren't as physically demanding but are still fulfilling, figuring out ways to chunk some hobbies into much smaller pieces so I can keep doing them, crying and raging and just letting whatever feelings come up and not trying to fight them or pretend they aren't there.</p>
<h3>5: Find support</h3>
<p>In all of this, the more support you have, the better. But I'll also say: trying to convince your healthy loved ones to acknowledge LC and that it's changed you can be really hard, and can in and of itself take a lot of spoons. Sometimes it's worth finding support in other places, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A local Long Covid clinic or support group:</strong> Before the funding dried up, my local health network had a LC clinic. As part of that clinic, they ran a free drop-in support group that met twice a month. That support group was a lifeline when I needed it most: I was among peers, and though we all had different experiences, we all also "got" how hard things were. See if there are any clinics or groups in your area.</li>
<li><strong>Therapy:</strong> Yup, you can find a therapist to talk to about these things. Ideally you'll want to look for someone who has experience working with folks who have chronic illness, so they have some understanding of where you're coming from. I imagine you could also try a grief counselor for this, though I never have. :)</li>
<li><strong>Online support groups:</strong> There are a few Facebook groups out there for LC members. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/COVID19survivorcorps/" title="Survivor Corps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Survivor Corps</a> is one. There are also a few groups specific to WHEN you got LC. I'm in a group called Long Haul COVID Fighters - Round 1 (Onset of illness PRIOR to 04/01/20), for example. I imagine there are subreddits and other such resources, too.</li>
<li><strong>Others in your extended circle:</strong> By being very "out" and vocal about having LC, I've become someone who my extended network reaches out to as they or their loved ones have issues with LC. Sometimes this is tiring to me, but it also allows me to connect with folks around LC and give them the support I never had in the beginning. It's also caused some much deeper relationships with people I already knew who have other chronic illnesses, chronic pain conditions, or terminal illnesses (which, in turn, has made me feel like I'm offering support to them--it's hugely helpful to feel like there are things I can give to others!).</li>
<li><strong>Books: </strong>I'm a reader, so I tend to turn to books to make sense of things I'm struggling with. A sampling of books that I've found helpful:
<ul>
<li>Meghan O'Rourke's <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-invisible-kingdom-reimagining-chronic-illness-meghan-o-rourke/17282876?ean=9780399573309" title="The Invisible Kingdom: Reimagining Chronic Illness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Invisible Kingdom: Reimagining Chronic Illness</a>: Though O'Rourke doesn't have LC, she does have other chronic conditions, and this is a good journey through the Western medical system and its ideas about illness and treatment, chronic illnesses and conditions, and what successfully managing one might look like.</li>
<li>Tricia Hersey's <a href="https://thenapministry.com/" title="Rest Is Resistance: A Manifesto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rest Is Resistance: A Manifesto</a>: Hersey runs The Nap Ministry and this is a manifesto that was well-timed for me to try to disentangle my own sense of self from being "productive" in capitalist terms. (And no, those weren't things I'd considered before I got sick...see the point about reprioritizing!)</li>
<li>Arthur W. Frank's <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-wounded-storyteller-body-illness-and-ethics-second-edition-arthur-w-frank/1838?ean=9780226004976" title="The Wounded Storyteller: Body, Illness, and Ethics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wounded Storyteller: Body, Illness, and Ethics</a>: I'd only recommend this one if you're really interested in how narrative impacts how we view the world, and if that's a concept you'd like to explore with regard to LC. It's not the easiest read, but the major narrative milestones he discusses resonated with me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Substacks:</strong> If you're of the emailed newsletter persuasion, there are some good Substacks out there. I'm currently following a few, including:
<ul>
<li>Tom Harris' <a href="https://thomasharris.substack.com/" title="The Long Hauler Sunbeam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Long Hauler Sunbeam</a> - a summary of some things in the news plus a little bit of sunshine and dog photos</li>
<li>Brandon's <a href="https://longcovidweekly.substack.com/" title="Long Covid Weekly Newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long Covid Weekly Newsletter</a> - weekly summary of news on LC and ME/CFS</li>
<li>Janna Moen's <a href="https://lcbreakdown.substack.com/" title="Long COVID Research Breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long COVID Research Breakdown</a> - a bit heavier/more scientific and less frequent, but she does a great job digging into stuff from a research perspective</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>That's all...for now</h2>
<p>I'm still trying to figure out what resources or guidance may be most useful for newcomers to the LC realm. If you've found your way here that way, please <a href="mailto:hikingwithsass@gmail.com" title="contact me" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reach out</a> and let me know what else I can share.</p>

<div class="talk-description">
<p>In 2018, I quit my job to hike the entire Appalachian Trail, also known as the AT. It took me 163 days. That’s 163 days of carrying everything I owned on my back, hiking for 10-12 hours a day, wearing the same clothes every day, and eating lots of foods in bar or dehydrated form.</p>
<p>The AT covers roughly 2100 miles as it crosses 14 states, from Georgia to Maine; Virginia is the single longest state, about a quarter of the trail. It has the reputation for causing a lot of potential thru-hikers to quit--so much so that the state of mind is known as the "Virginia Blues."</p>
<p>Virginia was the roughest state for me, by far. But using a variety of strategies, I was able to stay on trail and successfully complete my thru-hike.</p>
<p>Our work lives are full of large endurance projects. They can be really exciting, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting a new knowledge base from scratch</li>
<li>Taking ownership of an existing set of documentation</li>
<li>Building new curricula or programming</li>
<li>Building a major new feature</li>
<li>Hiking a really long trail (okay, maybe not this one)</li>
</ul>
<p>In all of these projects, there's an initial phase of enthusiasm and excitement followed by a period of productive work. Then there's this period in the middle where things feel all wrong--we don't feel like we're making progress; the project feels like it will never end; we feel overwhelmed; and it might even feel totally hopeless or outright impossible.</p>
<p>Somehow, we power through and finish the project. But we don't talk a lot about that rough patch in the middle. Until now.</p>
<p>This talk is all about that rough patch in the middle. You'll walk away with some actionable strategies you can use to help survive this lull in your next big project. And a few random facts about the Appalachian Trail to wow your friends.</p>

                <p>I've been spending a lot of time lately thinking and reflecting on who I am, what I'm doing, and what I'm going to do next. Think of it as a taking stock period before making changes, if you will.</p>
<p>And one of the things I'm working on is embracing the idea of being a maker.</p>
<p>Or, to be more specific, on battling some sense of imposter syndrome or unworthiness of the maker title.</p>
<p>I am a person who makes things. I create written content here and elsewhere, for starters. I also design and build my own furniture. It's nothing fancy, but it is functional and has clean lines. I usually find some kind of design online to use as a starting place or inspiration, and then create my own thing custom-tailored to the space and function I have available.</p>
<p>I don't have a garage or workshop space, and I don't even own a table saw, so it's quite an ordeal trying to do work on our tiny outside deck when it's not raining, or working up clamps and fences to rip plywood using a circular saw. My lack of a great space or tools likely does impact the quality of what I produce, but I'm still really happy with the stuff I build.</p>
<p>In the past year, I designed and built a storage shelf/display area for my turntable and LPs, as well as a couch with two chaises. In previous years, I built my own bed frame and one for a friend, my own spice rack and one for a friend, DVD shelves for my partner, and my bedside tables.</p>
<p>And I've recently started experimenting with making artistic spore prints of mushrooms, to extend one of my hobbies into a thing I can make, too.</p>
<p>So why, one might ask, haven't I historically identified as a maker? And why am I shifting into using the label at all?</p>
<p>Good questions, my lovely. Let's take them one at a time.</p>
<h2>Why I haven't considered myself a maker</h2>
<p>What feels like a lifetime ago, in my early twenties, I definitely described myself as a writer. I pursued two degrees in writing and a lot of my life was consumed by working on essays, short stories, and poems.</p>
<p>After I graduated with my M.A., I started adjunct teaching. And slowly, perhaps inexorably, I got so bogged down in the day-to-day of grading papers and preparing lessons and all the rest, I stopped my own writing. I focused on helping my students improve theirs, instead.</p>
<p>When I got burnt out on writing, I stumbled my way into the tech industry, by way of teaching myself how to design and administer databases. (For those of you fellow database geeks, I figured out third normal form organically and without knowing that's what it was called--relational database architecture just made sense to me.)</p>
<p>Somewhere in there was when I stopped thinking of myself as a writer, because I wasn't writing anymore and it felt odd to call myself that.</p>
<p>And despite the fact that I was designing and building databases, I never considered these creative or maker-worthy tasks.</p>
<p>As my tech career evolved, I started working at a small software company. I worked very closely with software engineers/developers, and that's basically what I've been doing for the last nine years. I've scoped features, done manual testing, written documentation, led webinars and training sessions on things. I've worked closely with devs to make decisions about how best to structure a feature or tweak a user interface.</p>
<p>But during that time, I always considered what I did as enabling and supporting people who did the "real" work of building the thing. I didn't write code or build features; I just did all the rest of the background work to make that possible.</p>
<p>Friends and coworkers would build their own websites from scratch, and I always felt somehow less creative or maker-ish because I preferred to use tools or frameworks that did most of the lifting for me.</p>
<p>At my most recent role, we tried to implement <a href="https://www.eosworldwide.com/what-is-eos" title="What is EOS? Overview of the Entrepreneurial Operating System" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS)</a>. The EOS model depends on a sort of split between a visionary (usually a CEO) and an implementer (usually a COO). It was clear, in every second of those discussions, that I was viewed as an implementer. My job wasn't to dream or come up with ideas; my job was to actually make the ideas a reality.</p>
<p>Many of those changes came down when I was at my heaviest Long Covid-induced brain fog, and to be fair, I <em>wasn't</em> generating a lot of ideas at that time. It was all I could do just to get through the day and not forget important events, concepts, or what I had started doing fifteen minutes ago.</p>
<p>Though we ultimately ended up not sticking with EOS, that binary division--and being on the implementer side of it--stuck with me. And it stuck with me long after my Long Covid baseline improved. I started writing this blog, for example. I started working out designs and measurements and building furniture again (which, I must say, is definitely a bit more complicated when you feel like your math skills aren't great anymore and you quadruple-check your math and still sometimes get things wrong!).</p>
<p>And yet, I still didn't think of myself as being especially creative or a maker.</p>
<p>So what changed?</p>
<h2>A tipping point</h2>
<p>There are few times in my life when I can point to a single crystalline moment where it felt like things changed, but in this case, I can.</p>
<p>I was having a text conversation with a dear friend, who I'm just going to call D here. At one point, I started talking to her about feeling angsty and like I was "over" software, but that I had no clue what to do instead.</p>
<p>And she, being the amazing human that she is, asked me some questions about what I enjoyed doing. Then she took it one step further and started dropping prompts into ChatGPT of all things, to get it to suggest ideas and business plans to move forward.</p>
<p>And many of those prompts had to do with very "maker" things: writing, building furniture, building frames for spore prints and selling them, giving talks on my experiences, etc.</p>
<p>It might sound silly, but that conversation helped me see myself a bit the way I imagine most of the people who know me DO see me: as a creative person.</p>
<p>Whether that's creative problem-solving, or writing a talk or blog post, or baking bread, or designing and making things myself, it occurred to me that a lot of the ways I choose to spend my time <em>are</em> creative pursuits, and they are pursuits that involve me making things, in some form or another.</p>
<p>I don't have to be a web developer to claim that title. I don't have to sell what I do. And I certainly don't have to be the world's most professional furniture builder to do it.</p>
<h2>Why call it a maker at all?</h2>
<p>I certainly don't have to have a label to do these things; so why add the label at all?</p>
<p>Oh, my lovely, I wish this had an easy answer. I'd love to say that I have transcended labels and I don't need them anymore. But the truth is, there's power in calling a thing by its name.</p>
<p>So much of processing the grief around a chronic illness is processing all the identities it makes you lose. I can't really consider myself an endurance athlete anymore, for example: my body just won't do it. I can't be the hustle and grind gal who travels a ton, either: my body just won't do it. The topology of my day-to-day and month-to-month existence is wildly different.</p>
<p>Those labels aren't really important, but the sense of self that was underneath them, and losing that, does.</p>
<p>So many of my posts here are about that grief, or figuring out what it means, and trying to reclaim my sense of self as a result. (See, for example, literally every blog post on here, though especially: <a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/on-resiliency.html" title="On resiliency" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On resiliency: Why I ditched the "you'll get better" narrative</a> or <a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/third-times-the-charm.html" title="Third time's the charm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Third time's the charm: Sass loses taste and smell yet again</a> or <a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/a-novel-ecosystem.html" title="A novel ecosystem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A novel ecosystem</a> or <a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/on-brain-fog.html" title="On brain fog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On brain fog: I never had to dream a paper moon</a>, for starters.)</p>
<p>But a huge part of processing that grief is to find new identities or routines or narratives to push you forward. I don't want to be sitting here constantly lamenting what's gone. I also need to find some good--some hope--in the life I'm living. Living, not just surviving.</p>
<p>Using the label might also be an act of defiance.</p>
<p>I defy that Long Covid has destroyed my ability to create things, or to tell meaningful stories. I defy this shitty reality we're all living in that seems to try to strip us of all things joyful. I defy the business and tech worlds that seem bent on painting people like me as implementers rather than creatives.</p>
<h2>But...what is a maker?</h2>
<p>Make: has a very short, lovely piece called "<a href="https://makezine.com/article/maker-news/what-is-a-maker-you-are/" title="What Is A Maker? You Are | Make:" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What Is A Maker? You Are</a>". It includes a quotation and a video clip from Adam Savage that resonates with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Humans do two things that make us unique from all other animals; we use tools and we tell stories. And when you make something, you’re doing both at once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's true that code isn't a tool I'm comfortable with. It's also true that my brain is not as sharp or fast as it was pre-Covid.</p>
<p>But neither of those things means I'm not a maker. I use tools. I tell stories. Sometimes I use tools to help me tell stories.</p>
<p>Maybe it's a silly act of defiance to slap a label on that. My homemade couch isn't going to change the world. Not on its own, anyway.</p>
<p class="dropcap">But if my homemade couch makes me feel creative, autonomous, energized--and if it's also a thing of comfort for my partner and the few people I allow inside my home--then it IS revolutionary.</p>
<p>It's revolutionary because it's helping me to defy a system of work that tells me I'm just a cog in a machine. Cogs don't think, they don't dream, they certainly don't make things. They're just workers, replaceable bits.</p>
<p>It's revolutionary because it's helping me to defy a system of consumption that reduces my entire existence down to my purchasing power, that implies that the only avenues I have to change the world are choosing what I buy.</p>
<p>I'm not a machine. I'm not a cog. And I sure as shit am not just a consumer.</p>
<p>I'm a human. Perfectly imperfect, struggling to figure myself out. Very human, one might say.</p>
<p>And because I'm a human, I'm also a maker.</p>
<p>As you are, my lovely. As we all are.</p>
<p>We don't have to make things for profit to be makers. We can just make.</p>
<p>We don't have to make things that will go viral or that will prompt people to pay us as influencers. We can just make.</p>
<p>For the sheer joy and sense of satisfaction in making something. Anything.</p>

                <p>I've been trying to figure out how to talk about one of those more elusive long Covid symptoms: brain fog.</p>
<p>This is one of those symptoms that seems to be easy for non-longhaulers to dismiss. It's therefore one of the things I wish I could explain well.</p>
<p>So back when I was in my early twenties, I was getting a Master's in Writing. I wrote all kinds of things, though I preferred poetry and short fiction. At least three separate times over the course of about a year and a half, I tried to write a poem about Ella Fitzgerald. It never came out right.</p>
<p>Then I studied poetry with Allison Adelle Hedge Coke. Allison pushed me and my writing in ways I hadn't been before, shoving me outside of the comfort zone of the more narrative/intellectual poems I'd been writing and into something a bit more freeform.</p>
<p>Of course I resisted that. I think every student has to, for a while.</p>
<p>But then one day partway through the semester, I suddenly got a first line about Ella Fitzgerald. And when I wrote it down, an entire poem came tumbling out. A poem totally unlike anything else I had ever written. It leaped through parts of my life, half-forgotten things, made some bold statements, and in so many ways felt like a fitting ode to scat and jazz.</p>
<p>I really can't stress how much of a break from my "usual" work this was. For me, it was more visceral, less linear, pulling together seemingly totally disparate threads from my own life. In many ways, it didn't feel like it came from me, but from somewhere else, like I was just a conduit for something the universe wanted to say.</p>
<p>I took it to class full of energy, and while not all of it made sense to my classmates, I got generally positive feedback on it. I made a few tweaks.</p>
<p>And when I went to perform it at our monthly community open mic, I tried something I had never done with any of my other poems: I memorized it and performed it from memory, no scrap of paper or notes in sight.</p>
<p>That process of memorizing each line prompted some small wording tweaks because there were just ways that the words fit together in my memory that were different from what I had on the page. I can still remember standing in my grad assistant office with its cream cinder block walls, reciting it over and over again aloud after everyone else had gone home for the day, making small adjustments, laughing at myself when I kept forgetting the same lines.</p>
<p>From that moment on, the poem became a part of me. I recited it at that open mic, and again from my memory when I gave my public thesis reading.</p>
<p>But for me, it transcended literary gatherings. I would recite it to myself when I was sad or depressed or angry. Similar to how some people use the Lord's Prayer, I think--it was a series of words that grounded me, calmed me, reminded me there was a much bigger world than my present moment and that I was connected to that world. I would often recite it while I was out hiking, because something about it felt so joyfully present.</p>
<p>But I often used it in the most stressful moments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost a decade later, I was traveling in Europe and ended up touring Dachau on my thirtieth birthday. I was getting a different degree this time, on a school trip, but I had a hard time getting back on the tour bus. I wanted to cry and rage and scream; I didn't understand how inhuman and inhumane humans can be. (I still don't understand this.) I sat in a row of bus seats by myself and quietly whispered this poem to myself, through tears.</li>
<li>A year later, in the midst of my divorce, I took endless walks to calm my mind, and I got into meditation. I would recite the poem repeatedly on walks, and I often said it when I settled down to meditate, as a way to clear my mind and set an open intention.</li>
<li>My mom died the day before I started my move from Washington, DC, to Maine. And on the first day of the move, so many things went wrong. I'd scheduled movers to help me load up my moving truck and reserved my building's loading dock, but when I picked up the truck and got to the dock, a utility vehicle blocked the dock. My movers were there, already on the clock, and I had to track down a front desk worker who could track down the electrician to get him to move his car, which delayed everything by almost 45 minutes. Then once everything was packed and loaded, I went back to the moving truck location to have them hook up the trailer for my car and get my car loaded, and none of the staff there seemed to know how to hook the car up. In the end, instead of leaving DC around 1pm, I left at the start of evening rush hour. I then had to drive through a Noreaster (because of course I did), and almost got blown off the Delaware Memorial Bridge. I kept reciting the poem aloud, trying to stay awake and together enough to get through the drive.</li>
<li>And when I was thru-hiking and my mind had exhausted every other thing it could think of to occupy itself, I would often recite it to myself or aloud as I hiked, timing the rhythm of the words to my footsteps.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which is to say: I could call upon this poem at any moment, often under extreme emotional or physical duress, and it was always there. I could feel the shape of the stanzas, I knew all the pauses, I long ago stopped having to think about the words and just had them come tumbling out.</p>
<p>So, fast forward a bit, to a random Friday night in November 2022. I was, by this point, a good two and a half years into long Covid. I felt I was managing really well--my fatigue wasn't totally debilitating, I'd figured out how to manage my energy better so I mostly wasn't having huge flares in symptoms, and most people I interacted with had no idea that I'd been through anything so hard.</p>
<p>I was driving home from buying groceries on a day that had felt somewhat stressful, and as had been happening a lot, my mind circled the stress of still not being able to buy a house. A lot of my stress in 2021, 2022, and 2023 has been from this--my landlord has raised our rent and periodically threatens to sell our house; I want to buy a house so I have stability, a yard for my dog, a garden for myself, and to have some control over expensive things like furnaces and hot water heaters.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, driving home this night, I was near tears.</p>
<p>And to calm myself, I started stuttering out the poem. It's an ancient comfort now, nearly 20 years old.</p>
<p>And I couldn't make it through the end of the first stanza.</p>
<p>It just wasn't there, in my head, anymore.</p>
<p>The whole comforting shape and feel of the poem, of words that I had thought permanently etched into my psyche...it was gone.</p>
<p>I tried to save it, to skip the end of the first stanza, to jump into a place I could remember further down, which helped me re-remember part of the first stanza, but then I forgot the next stanza's transition and the entire ending.</p>
<p>But "forgot" isn't the right word. I didn't forget it. There was just nothing where it normally was, a gaping hole that I was flailing around in, trying to find something to hold onto.</p>
<p>It was as if someone had slapped me, or dropped me into a pool of ice. The shock--and the horror--of it being gone...it's the creative thing I'm the proudest of having written, and it had become a kind of mantra through thick and thin, a kind of prayer against the dark and the horror. A thing that was so much a part of me that I could remember it in extreme stress, and yet here I was, on a fairly normal Friday night, and I was clutching at tiny fragments of it instead.</p>
<p>I did fully start crying at that point. Somehow I didn't drive off the road. Somehow.</p>
<p>As a long-ago graduation present, two dear friends printed a lovely version of my poem as a small poster, with a photo of Ella Fitzgerald. I framed it and it hangs in my entryway.</p>
<p>When I got home, I reread it.</p>
<p>The words were there, and that was some comfort, but the <em>feel</em> of the poem's shape was gone. I could recognize the words as things I'd written, and parts of them conjured feelings for me, but that deeply ingrained feeling that had been a part of me since I had first memorized it...that was gone.</p>
<p>I don't know if anyone who's not inside my head can understand how brutal this loss was. But this is exactly what long Covid brain fog is. It takes things you know inside and out, extremely well...and then it hides them, makes them feel foreign and unfamiliar when you least expect it.</p>
<p>Today, writing this, I just closed my eyes and recited the poem, albeit somewhat haltingly. Most of it is here, now. But I don't trust it. It feels like I am forgetting something important, like I should go check the text to be sure.</p>
<p>This is what this illness does to you. Even when you are doing "well", it's a tenuous and fragile wellness, and it takes so little to make you doubt that perceived wellness.</p>
<p>So please, if you are an otherwise healthy person, please don't think that forgetting to do a task at work, or forgetting to buy eggs when you're at the store, is comparable to the brain fog those of us with chronic illnesses have. If you haven't felt like a core memory or piece of you has gone missing on a dark and miserable night and might never find its way home, then it's not brain fog.</p>

                <p>For months now, I know I've been past the point of considering long Covid as something I'll "get over". I still know some longhaulers who aggressively follow the research (both real and bullshit) and keep trying to find that one magic answer that will "fix" them. I'm not one of those people. At this point I've read enough about chronic illness to recognize that what I have falls into that class of illness, and the shift has been to one of managing it rather than trying to fully recover from it.</p>
<p>And when I've tried to describe this attitude to people, what I usually say is something like this:</p>
<p>Collectively, we tend to view the body in mechanical terms. Like a car: when a car isn't running smoothly, you take it to the mechanic, they can diagnose what's mechanically wrong, and make adjustments or swap out parts to get that car back to smooth running.</p>
<p>But the body isn't a machine.</p>
<p>It's an ecosystem.</p>
<p>And chronically ill bodies are places where the ecosystem has been thrown out of whack, due to pollution or invasive species or catastrophic event or something else. We don't ever expect that these ecosystems will return to their original composition, but we do expect that they will find a new homeostasis.</p>
<hr>
<p>So that's how I'd been describing things, to the extent that I was describing them.</p>
<p>I just finished reading Cal Flyn's book <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/islands-of-abandonment-nature-rebounding-in-the-post-human-landscape-cal-flyn/15606084?ean=9781984878212" title="Islands of Abandonment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Islands of Abandonment: Nature Rebounding in the Post-Human Landscape</a>.</p>
<p>In it, Flyn recounts stories and travel experiences to abandoned/damaged areas and how those areas rebound.</p>
<p>Metaphorically appropriate, no?</p>
<p>At any rate, there's a section in the book talking about ecosystems that have been ravaged by non-native species, what we most commonly call invasive species. I'm just going to quote directly here (p. 222):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That non-native species should be able to settle in--and even come to serve some helpful roles--does throw a little cold water over the idea of the ecosystem as the intricately wrought, carefully balanced product of millennia of coevolution, each species carving its way into the genes of the others' as water sculpts rocks. Indeed, it is the success of aliens like maesopsis, all over the world, that has fed into a bold new perspective, one that seeks to reevaluate environments "tainted" by the proliferation of non-native species.<br><br>Such ecosystems, suggests this new school of thought, are "novel ecosystems"--created by man, but self-sustaining. And it is time to accept the fact that they have changed forever, cannot be returned to a previous "unspoiled" state--indeed, that the notion of their being spoiled in the first place may be incorrect--and appreciate them, for what they are now. It is, write its proponents, "the new ecological world order." They quote Goethe: "[Nature] is ever shaping new forms: what is, has never yet been; what has been, comes not again."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I keep turning this over in my mind, how wedded we are to the idea of taint or destruction of a pristine former state. Where does that idea of pristine nature--or, for that matter, a "healthy" body as the natural default--come from? Are we wedded to the idea of the body as machine because that makes it less terrifying and unpredictable (as nature can be)?</p>
<hr>
<p>They're not easy questions to try to unravel, and truthfully today my brain is foggy enough, my energy low enough, that it's futile to ask.</p>
<p>But there's something here, in that idea of appreciating a novel ecosystem--that something is not spoiled, but merely different from what we expected, but no less complex and no less worthy of appreciation.</p>
<p>Imagine, for a moment, that an ecosystem has a consciousness. That it's conscious of itself as an entity. (Here, I tend to think of systems I know well--watersheds where I've hiked, areas I've lived. Maybe there's calming water or big sentinel trees or just a vista I know well--picture one that makes sense to you.)</p>
<p>Imagine what that consciousness experiences when a wildly invasive new species shows up, smothering all the patterns and balances that were there before, throwing everything off-kilter.</p>
<p>There'd be all the feelings of grief, I suspect. Rage, sadness, denial, depression...so many feelings.</p>
<p>But ecosystems don't just stop; they keep going. Eventually, that so-called invasive species usually hits a point where the ecosystem can't sustain its insane growth, and the invasive species population semi-collapses--or some other piece of the ecosystem adapts to limit it. From that point onward, that non-native species becomes a part of the ecosystem--sometimes, even, a very integral part of it.</p>
<p>True, there's a lot potentially lost here: native species that couldn't compete and have been obliterated, maybe entire segments of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>But I imagine the ecosystem would feel sort of proud, at that point. It might look back on the before times with a bit of sadness, but there would also be pride at having weathered that shit time when everything seemed to be falling apart. Pride at having survived that time, pride in achieving a newer version of itself that is now balanced again rather than giving up. The details won't ever be the same, the balance might be a bit more tenuous and fragile than before, but what an achievement.</p>
<p>It's not that hard for me to imagine, because quite honestly, this is my life.</p>
<p>I had an unusual, highly-invasive virus enter the ecosystem of my body, and it threw off a careful balance that had been working pretty darn well my whole life. And for the first couple years, that intruder threw my ecosystem into chaos. Nothing could be expected to work as it did before, even things that seemed like they should have been unaffected somehow were. It felt like there was no way forward.</p>
<p>Yet, somehow, slowly, some sense of balance has returned. It's nowhere near the balance I had before--it's definitely more fragile. Things work very differently than they did before, and as a consequence, my life and my self are very different. I keep having to try to re-embrace the idea of letting go of the previous version of this ecosystem. Looking at pictures of how strong and stable and well-constructed it once was just makes me long for those "unspoiled" days. (If they ever existed...increasingly, I think the perception of them as unspoiled was itself deeply flawed.)</p>
<p>But the fact that my ecosystem body has found any path forward--that I'm not still in the throes of the really dark days of 2020 and 2021, that I no longer feel like I'm slipping into dementia and going to run out of air, that my skin isn't erupting in weird hive-like responses to certain stimuli, I have any sense of taste or smell at all, and I don't wake up each day with a fresh hellacious symptom--it's really f*cking amazing, frankly.</p>
<p>Thanks to the novel coronavirus and the ways it impacted my body, I am now a novel ecosystem.</p>
<p>In a world where we're coming to grips with the omnipresence of microplastics, forever chemicals like PFAS, Superfund sites, kudzu, pythons, hitchhiking zebra mussels, and climate change, our entire world is becoming a patchwork of novel ecosystems.</p>
<p>Maybe this just puts me one step ahead of the game in understanding that and still finding a way to get out of bed each day.</p>
<p>Or maybe it just makes it easier for me to explain what this feels like.😅</p>

        <title>Why breaking my Duolingo streak is an act of self-care</title>

                <p>This year, I'm starting off the new year with a somewhat unorthodox choice: to break my 1294-day Duolingo streak.</p>
<p>I know that's the opposite of most people's New Year's resolutions, so it probably warrants a bit of explanation.</p>
<p>I've been using Duolingo since July 2015. For most of that time, I've maintained streaks of activity, though before 2019 I didn't really care about the streak. I'd been wanting to learn French for years. Duolingo was easy to fit into my day, even when I traveled a lot for work. And at least once I almost "finished" the French course, only to have a redesign and restructure kick me back down several levels.</p>
<p>I've had a few times where I got out of the habit. Thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail, for example: I didn't practice French at all then. And I was a bit patchy picking it back up after I finished the trail, until I started using a habit-tracking app that I set to ask me every day if I'd practiced Duolingo.</p>
<p>In early 2020, I was on a several-months' streak and enjoying the consistency of the habit.</p>
<p>Then, of course, I got sick with Covid and developed long Covid, with brain fog and fatigue. I already had a 200+ day streak at that point. And although I often could only make it through a review or a single lesson in a day, I clung stubbornly to this routine. I didn't drop my streak, despite being so full of fatigue I couldn't get out of bed and often forgetting English words I used all the time--French was much harder.</p>
<p>Long Covid took so much from me for so long. I went from being an endurance athlete to, almost overnight, getting winded going up a flight of stairs. My heart rate was all over the place; my steel trap memory suddenly had gaping holes where things used to be. For a while I couldn't even focus enough to read. Duolingo was, in a very real way, one of the only habits that I successfully carried over from the before long Covid (BLC) times.</p>
<p>I have stuck with it, working my way through every verb tense, learning a bunch of sentences that have no real meaning in real life. Just a couple weeks ago, I finally "finished" the French course (though, of course, thanks to more redesigns, I haven't actually finished unless I hit the Legendary level on all previous levels). I still wouldn't say I can speak French at all. My audio processing is pretty slow, and my speech isn't awesome. I can read it passably well. But I've developed a decent foundation.</p>
<p>So why, you might be asking, did I give up that 1294-day streak?</p>
<p>It's a multi-layered answer.</p>
<p>The first part is that I hate the new UI and format they rolled out a few weeks ago. I was one of those learners who focused singularly on a given skill and worked all the way through it before moving on (which was a boon with my brain fog, since it often took staggering levels of repetition before I could bludgeon my memory to make space for things). The new layout makes that impossible, and it's left me feeling constantly insecure and confused.</p>
<p>The second part is that I have achieved a chunk of the goal I set out for myself: I got all the way through the course, all levels (ignoring Legendary, which has only existed for a little while).</p>
<p>But the third part is...harder to articulate.</p>
<p>Why would I cut this one continuous thread of my BLC brain and life?</p>
<p>For me, Duolingo was about setting an intention in my life (to rudimentarily learn French) and sticking to that intention. For a long time, that intention made me feel good. I did Duolingo every day (usually in the morning, sometimes at night). I learned things. It was fun.</p>
<p>Even once I got into some of the trickier verb tenses that were pretty hard to "intuitively" wrap my head around and it felt more like work, it still felt good. My stressed and stretched-thin long Covid brain could still do this thing I used to be able to do. That felt important. It was an act of resistance against this poorly-defined, poorly-understood, untreatable illness.</p>
<p>But here, starting 2023, coming up quite quickly on my 3rd year anniversary of having long Covid, I find that I want to let go of some of those threads to BLC me.</p>
<p>There's a lot of grief with chronic illness. Lots of grief and lots of mourning. We lose so much: a sense of stability and predictability, the unexamined presumption of "health" as "normal", all the identities we once had that our bodies make unsustainable. The self basically disintegrates before our eyes and we are left trying to find some way to move forward. Some way to have hope when all of the specific things you once hoped for are no longer possible with the increasingly finite, wildly unpredictable resources your body allows.</p>
<p>I've been reading Arthur W. Frank's <em>The Wounded Storyteller</em>. Frank identifies a few common narrative models that people with serious illness can follow: restitution, chaos, and quest. And I can see that evolution in my own thinking. I held onto Duolingo for a while because I assumed I'd recover and I didn't want to have lost my streak (restitution). Then I held onto it because everything in my life and my very self was dissolving, crumbling, and was so unpredictable I couldn't find words to describe it (chaos). It was a tiny moment of consistency in an otherwise tumultuous storm.</p>
<p>But now, starting this year, I'm thinking a lot more about intentionality as it relates to long Covid. In discussing the importance of testimony and recognition with chronic illness, Frank says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The danger for ill people is that they are often taught how to be ill by professionals. Illness is not presented to the ill as a moral problem; people are not asked, after the shock of diagnosis has dulled sufficiently, what do you wish to <strong>become</strong> in this experience? What story do you wish to tell of yourself? How will you shape your illness, and yourself, in the stories you tell of it? (159)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can't fully answer these questions yet, though my posts here are one way I'm trying to find my way to those answers.</p>
<p>What I do know is that I don't want to be clinging to some sense of what used to be normal. Even in the vague way that Duolingo has provided, there is always this subtle feeling of difference between how that experience is<em> now</em> vs. what it was like <em>before</em>.</p>
<p>I don't want my story to be: here's this thing I used to do really easily and now I'm tenaciously sticking to it even though it's really hard and isn't fun or rewarding at all. That's empty stubbornness, and almost willful clinging to the past.</p>
<p>Long Covid has taught me how expressly important it is, as a chronically ill person, to be adaptable. To define--and redefine--for yourself what a full life looks like. Because you're the only one who can. You're the only one who understands what feels like a reasonable challenge vs. an unachievable and almost cruel challenge.</p>
<p>So I would like to redefine this. I'm walking away from Duolingo, but not learning French. My plan is to start trying to read more actual things in French, try to listen to some of the easy French podcasts, and seek out other alternatives that aren't as tidy as an app that tracks my completion but that can give me back some of those feelings of fulfillment and competence I had before. Free from the tyranny of the streak, my hope is that I can structure and pursue learning as it makes sense in my life.</p>
<p>Resolutions are often about habits. They're about expressing an intention and then committing action to follow through on that intention.</p>
<p>So my resolution is to let go of this highly structured but no longer purposeful habit and explore alternative habits that help me pick up the melody of the original goal but in a tune that my current body can carry.</p>
<p>On the Appalachian Trail, there are a lot of places where you can choose to follow side trails--which are often more scenic and are sometimes shorter. The AT is marked with white blazes; the side trails are generally blue. On my thru-hike, I was a religious white blaze follower. It's taken me an extra 4+ years, nerve damage in my feet, and a chronic untreatable illness, but I think I'm finally coming around to the idea of blue-blazing. Because sometimes how you choose to make your way is even more important than the journey itself.</p>
<p>And if my story here can be useful in any way, I hope that's what you take from it: you always can--and should--walk away from things that aren't serving you or are causing undue stress. You don't have to wield self-control like a mace. Offer your body and your mind a little grace and see what makes your life feel whole rather than full.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, my partner made a vegetarian curry dish with sweet potatoes, chickpeas, and rice.</p>
<p>Three bites into the meal, I realized I couldn't taste the curry. At all.</p>
<p>Since then, I've been paying attention and I'm back to where I was about a year ago, with limited sense of taste and reduced sense of smell.</p>
<p>When I mention this to most overall healthy people, they immediately ask me what I think caused it. Sometimes I answer this question by running through a list of vaguely logical options:</p>
<ul>
<li>About 4 weeks ago, I completed a 5k doing 60-second run-walk intervals. It was cold and my body hated it, my heart rate was higher than it had been for my training. The cold stressed my body and I almost puked by the end of the race. Maybe this had long-term repercussions.</li>
<li>About 2 weeks ago, I got a flu shot. I was quite sick the day after, mildly okay two days after, and then quite sick again the day after that. I've been tired since then, back to the land of "can't get enough sleep". Maybe the flu shot was a bad idea (did it trigger a disproportionate inflammatory response in my immune system?). Or getting it "so soon" after the 5k was too much. Or maybe it's nothing.</li>
<li>It's actually winter now. My body seems to hate the cold, so it could just be the fact of winter itself causing issues, somehow.</li>
<li>It's actually winter now, so our forced air furnace is running. My body doesn't seem to like the HVAC system in our rental, so maybe that's triggering it. Or, in tandem with the cold. Or, in tandem with any of the other bullet points listed above.</li>
</ul>
<p>But what I really want to say to them is: I have a long Covid body. 1 + 1 stopped adding up to 2 in my body 2.5+ years ago. There doesn't have to be a reason. Sometimes you just hit a point of stress that causes a flare of symptoms, and it's hard to say exactly what it is.</p>
<p>All I can do at this point is to try to remove stressors, get lots of rest, and hope.</p>
<p>Though there are things I don't tell them.</p>
<p>I don't tell them that the night I ate that curry, I went into the bathroom to take my shower and sobbed through my whole shower.</p>
<p>Because you think you've found a way to manage your illness, you think it kind of makes sense and now you can make things livable. And then something that you worked really hard to regain disappears again, just like that, and you're reminded not only that none of it is within your control, not only that the doctors still can't do diddly squat to help you, but also that every time you lose it, you're going to be full of grief. There is no "normal", anymore. There's a baseline that you try to maintain and some days are great and some are still really shitty. And you're not really sure how you managed to get good days for a while once the bad ones return.</p>
<p>I also don't tell them that when I voiced fear about the 5k or the flu shot tipping my body over the edge, they told me I shouldn't live my life in fear and to just do it. What I want to scream at them is that this isn't irrational fear: given the data I have to work with, it is completely legitimate, warranted fear. The idea that I might have somehow brought this on myself by these "risky" actions--actions which most everyone else didn't consider risky at all--is so sour I want to spit it out of my mouth. (Or it would be, if I could taste sour things.)</p>
<p>I cried, but I also wanted to scream. I wanted to rage around the house and break things, and just...lash out with all of it. I didn't. I sobbed in the shower and went to bed. Then I managed to tell my whole team at work that I'm sicker again and will need some grace and flexibility; please don't schedule back-to-back meetings with me for hours on end. And I started testing what I can and can't taste and smell. The losses aren't as bad as 2020 and 2021's were, I still have a few flavors I can taste that aren't salt or hot sauce, and a few smells that aren't burning things and dog farts (which were the two smells I could smell for all of 2020 and a good chunk of 2021).</p>
<p>But if there's all this stuff I won't say to most people, why write about it here?</p>
<p>Well, the first reason is simple: I need to speak this out so it doesn't just fester in my body and turn me bitter and rageful. Venting some steam.</p>
<p>But also: somewhere out there, I imagine there's another spoonie who's also going through a recurring loss of a good baseline. And that loss slapped them in the face, took their breath away, and left them sobbing and confused and lonely and angry and sad all at once. Whatever that loss was, it probably seemed small to outsiders (aren't you used to this by now?) and yet it feels huge and overwhelming and how on earth does any of us go on living.</p>
<p>So you, random chronically ill person I don't actually know: I'm writing this for you. You're not alone. That rage and grief and confusion you're feeling? It's totally normal for your situation. There are lots of us who go through the same things. I'm here to write a little of it down so that we can both recognize that the emperor has no f*cking clothes on and maybe laugh or cry a bit about how absurd it is that no one else notices.</p>
<p>Also, if your sense of taste and smell still work, please go eat some curry and revel in what an amazing thing those senses are. Lean your face over the bowl or plate, close your eyes, and inhale deeply and just f*cking luxuriate in it. Take a couple bites and let them sit in your mouth a little longer so you can get the full wave of different flavors. And then send me a single thought of flare recovery vibes. 🙃</p>

                <p>As I've thought about <a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/hike-the-hike-youve-been-given.html" title="Hike the Hike You've Been Given" target="null">Hike the Hike You've Been Given</a>, and what that has looked like in my thru-hiking and long Covid life, I've realized that I can probably distill it down even further. </p>
<p>Accepting the hike or chronic illness or whatever it is you've been given is also about reclaiming the story of your life. It's taking a story that has some seriously negative turns to it and viewing it in a positive way.</p>
<p>I'm not talking about forced or toxic positivity. This isn't let's pretend it's all sunshine and roses.</p>
<p>It is, instead, to focus on a core thread in the story itself.</p>
<p>For me, that thread is resiliency.</p>
<p>I have to thank Amy, the long Covid therapist I saw, for this word. It has a lot of power. 🙌</p>
<p class="dropcap">One of the things I've found hardest about having long Covid is that a lot of very well-intentioned, well-meaning people spent weeks and months telling me that I'd "get back to where I was before in no time." We've probably all said something like this to a friend going through a break-up, a job change, or other tough times, and it's meant as a reassurance, a way of saying: hey, I know it sucks right now, but this is abnormal and you'll get back to normal soon enough. Chin up.</p>
<p>But there are times that this is the complete opposite of reassuring.</p>
<p>First of all, it assumes that the "normal" state of life for most of us is one of stability and a fixed, defined identity. That's patently false.</p>
<p>"Normal" life is a rollercoaster. Things are always falling apart and coming back together, then falling apart again. Stuff breaks. We get stressed, we get anxious, we get depressed.</p>
<p>Trying to define "normal" as somehow absent of those things has this implicit effect of making us feel bad for not being "normal". And if your situation is turning out to be more chronic and long-lasting--like long Covid, for example--it makes you feel like you will never be "normal" again. No bueno.</p>
<p>Thru-hikers often intuitively pick up on this. The trail gives you endless ups and downs, every day. You might score a beautiful camping spot only to have it downpour for the next four days, and you're putting on still soaking wet socks and shirt. You might push hard to get to a summit that's supposed to have gorgeous views just to have it walled in with fog. You might get an amazing care package full of love and good food from friends but it weighs more than the rest of your pack combined. Or the trail you're supposed to be hiking might look like this:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.livewithsass.com/media/posts/3/IMG_20180623_102309-2.jpg" alt="A steep uphill sloped covered in a jumble of rocks.

<figcaption >No, this is not a random jumble of rocks. See the trail blaze at the very top? It's the trail. :)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="dropcap">But more than this false measure of "normal", the entire piece of advice strips you of the story of overcoming difficulties. Of being resilient.</p>
<p>When friends or family told me I'd get back to normal before I knew it, or back to where I'd been health- or fitness-wise, my response changed over time.</p>
<p>In the first few days and weeks, it was a kind of reassurance. This was temporary, and the reassurance felt good.</p>
<p>But as this dragged on to months and then years, it seemed flat and full of denial.</p>
<p>And eventually, it felt gross to me because the fact was: I'd been through a lot of shit <em>and I wanted to celebrate that, own it, and have people recognize it.</em></p>
<p>Let's be real: it's really shitty to have long Covid. It's weeks and months of riding a rollercoaster of exhaustion and fatigue, where it takes every ounce of will-power you might have just to get out of bed and do even simple things. The brain fog can be mild (taking a split-second longer to remember a thing) or thick and heavy (forgetting names of people, forgetting major emotional events just days after they happen).</p>
<p>I still have very little sense of smell or taste two years in. I've had random allergic skin reactions to a range of foods I used to eat regularly. I have persistent tinnitus in one ear and hypersensitive hearing the rest of the time. Each day is like a roulette wheel of symptoms, and though my daily baseline has improved with time, it's still a roulette wheel. The consequences are just a bit more expected and predictable now than they were in 2020.</p>
<p>When you tell me I'll be back where I was, you basically erase all of that struggle because you don't acknowledge it. You sweep it under the rug as a "temporary" thing. I'm two years in. This isn't temporary. This is my new normal. And it's a really hard normal.</p>
<p class="dropcap">Quite frankly: it's the biggest endurance effort I've ever undertaken. Way harder than thru-hiking, which I could choose to quit at any time. I don't get to opt out of this reality. There are no zero days, no trail magic, no quitting and going home. Like Groundhog Day, I wake up to this same reality no matter what I do.</p>
<p>I'm not saying all of that so that you'll have sympathy or pity for me.</p>
<p>I'm saying it because: I'm resilient. I continue to live in this shifting roulette, and I do it reasonably gracefully. Most people have no idea how rough my day to day life is. I'm still working, still walking my dog, still cooking even if I can't properly taste what I make. I have some dreams and some hopes now, too, which was unthinkable a year ago.</p>
<p>I'm a resilient warrior. I've been through so much, and continue to go through so much.</p>
<p>So don't tell me I'll get back to being who I used to be. That woman is long gone. The woman I am now is much wiser even if her brain doesn't work as well. She's gentler, more thoughtful, generally a better listener. She thinks more from her heart than her head. She considers that people bring all kinds of baggage to each interaction that might not be remotely visible.</p>
<p>She's a kinder person, even if she has way less energy.</p>
<p>And I want you to see her and know that She. Is. Me. Not that picture you have of me from 2.5 years ago. Messy, exhausted, fatigued me, now. And I'll continue to grow and change as I keep living with this condition. I'll keep being in turns angry and disappointed in medical science for not being able to help me, and I'll keep trying to figure out ways to help myself.</p>
<p class="dropcap">In so many ways, all of us--every single damn one of us--need to drop this story of stability being "normal" and this other stuff being a detour or a distraction. It's neither. Life is always this mixture of more stable and less stable things, of pleasure and pain, of mountain summits and grueling rough terrain. If there's one thing I wish I could tell my pre-long-Covid self, it's that: stop thinking it's supposed to be great all the time and you're somehow messing up if it's not. It's supposed to be a grab bag, and the people who are living with sass are rolling with whatever comes out of that bag, every day.</p>
<p>Don't try to get back to some previously stable/amazing point in your life--recognize that you're a more amazing person now having gone through all that stuff and continuing to go through and still getting up and living your life anyway.</p>
<p>Find your resilient story. I promise you, it's in there. You've overcome a lot, and you'll overcoming a lot, and THAT is the story of your life. </p>

<p>In 2018, I hiked the Appalachian Trail, solo. I developed serious nerve problems in my feet but still completed my hike.</p>
<p>In March of 2020, I contracted COVID. I soon developed what's called longhaul Covid or just Long Covid (I may abbreviate this as LC, too).</p>
<p>This site is my attempt to make sense of all those experiences and draw parallels between them, to share talks or other presentations I've given, and just generally to offer support to others facing challenging endurance efforts and chronic illnesses.</p>
<p>I believe we can all live our lives with a little more sass.</p>
