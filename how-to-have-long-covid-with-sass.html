These sometimes range from things like "How do I support someone in my life who has Long Covid?" to "I think I have Long Covid. What do I do?"</p><p>I'm not a medical expert, nor a therapist, nor a grief counselor. But I have had this lived experience since March of 2020, so I'm just going to share things I've learned. If you found your way here in search of treatments or suggestions, consult a doctor or other medical professional before making any changes. Most importantly: Long Covid can vary wildly from individual to individual, so what works for me might actually make your symptoms worse.</p><h2>What is Long Covid?</h2><p>Long Covid is known by a few different names, including:</p><ul><li>Long haul Covid</li><li>Post-Covid Conditions (PCC)</li><li>Post-Acute COVID-19</li><li>Chronic COVID</li><li>Post-acute Sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection (PASC)</li></ul><p>There's no hard diagnostic criteria for it and no test to determine if you have Long Covid (LC). It's not a single illness, but can be a new, returning, or ongoing health problem experienced after being infected with COVID-19. To qualify as LC these days, the symptoms need to exist more than 4 weeks after your infection. There is also no full scientific consensus on what causes LC symptoms. And the range of symptoms is staggering--there are several different "flavors" of LC (generally identified by common clusters of symptoms), but most two people with LC will have some overlap and some differences in what they have. In some cases, LC seems to stem from or cause autoimmune conditions, and while some of those conditions have treatments, there is no known treatment or cure for LC.</p><p>So just to sum up: there is no test to determine if you have it, no single verified reason why you get it, and paltry little to do to treat it.</p><p>I don't say all of this to bum you out, but just to note that this is a field where a lot of studies and research are currently happening, and while there are a lot of headlines of maybe-promising things, there's very little for a patient to definitively hold on to in the land of "feeling better."</p><p>In the US, the CDC provides <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html" title="Long COVID or Post-COVID Conditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a summary (rather than comprehensive) list of commonly reported symptoms</a>, which include:</p><ul><li>Tiredness or fatigue that interferes with daily life (Me!)</li><li>Symptoms that get worse after physical or mental effort, aka post-exertional malaise (Me!)</li><li>Fever (Me in the first year, rarely now)</li><li>Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath (Me, off and on)</li><li>Cough (Me, mainly year 1)</li><li>Chest pain</li><li>Fast-beating or pounding heart (Me, at various points, thankfully not often anymore)</li><li>Difficulty thinking or concentrating, aka "brain fog" (Me!)</li><li>Headache (Rarely me, but a lot in the first year)</li><li>Sleep problems (Me!)</li><li>Dizziness when you stand up (I've always had this at random moments, so...me, but probably not from LC)</li><li>Pins-and-needles feelings</li><li>Change in smell or taste (Me! I lost my sense of smell and taste almost completely for a year, and when I regained it, it was about 50% what it was before, and I still struggle in the winter)</li><li>Depression or anxiety</li><li>Diarrhea (Me, after my second Covid infection. Wasn't part of my initial experience)</li><li>Stomach pain (Ditto on the second Covid infection)</li><li>Joint or muscle pain (Me, mostly in the first year)</li><li>Rash (Me x 2!)</li><li>Changes in menstrual cycles (Me!)</li></ul><p>Making all these symptoms even more delightful is that, for many longhaulers, all known tests will say that you are perfectly healthy. I've had a barrage of routine blood tests, heart and lung tests, a brain MRI to evaluate me for stroke, and a cardiopulmonary stress test. All came back as "perfectly healthy" despite the fact that when I had many of them done, I struggled to get out of bed, had no sense of smell, and could barely cognitively function.</p><h2>How I manage my Long Covid</h2><p>Just to reiterate my disclaimer from above: None of what I'm sharing here is a suggestion that others do what I do. Long Covid is highly individualistic and what works for me might make someone else's symptoms worse.</p><h3>1: Track your data</h3><p>No, not like some kind of biohacking bro, but for real: track your data. This is especially helpful if medical tests aren't giving you any kind of concrete answers. The only way to determine if changes you make have a positive or negative impact on your symptoms--which is essential to managing a chronic illness--is to track a baseline and then track what happens when you add or remove things from your life.</p><p>My own data tracking has gone through two distinct phases:</p><h4>Phase 1: Food + hydration + symptoms journal</h4><p>Back in 2020, this was my first attempt at trying to understand what my body was doing. At that time, there was even less understanding of LC than we have now. (Heck, my doctor's office was completely closed for the first almost two months of my symptoms.)</p><p>I woke up every day with different symptoms; I called it symptom roulette. So the lack of medical guidance plus the complete and total feeling like my body was out of control led me to start a journal to try to make sense of what was going on.</p><p>What I tracked evolved and changed over time, and I had to find things that worked for me. But what I mainly tracked boiled down a few key things:</p><ul><li><strong>A list of symptoms.</strong> I usually logged these in the morning and then just reviewed to add anything new over the course of the day.</li><li><strong>Energy score.</strong> I made this up, and it was my way or trying to rate how much energy I had on any given day, since overwhelming fatigue has been a dominant symptom for me. I used a 1-10 scale, where 1 was nearly comatose and 10 was Energizer Bunny. In my first year of LC, I don't think I ever got above a 5.</li><li><strong>Food journal.</strong> I wrote down every food I ate, every supplement or vitamin I tried, and every non-water beverage I drank. Not for calories or macronutrients, but just to try to detect patterns.</li><li><strong>Hydration journal.</strong> I tracked the amount of water I drank and, if I took electrolyte supplements, what I took.</li><li><strong>Weight.</strong> I don't track this anymore, but in the early days, my symptoms worsened if my weight spiked one day, so it felt like a helpful proxy marker.</li><li><strong>Activity. </strong>I tracked what physical activity I engaged in each day. In the beginning, this was quite minimal due to extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, and racing heartbeat. But over time, I was able to do more.</li></ul><p>This journaling helped me in several ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Perspective.</strong> It was very easy, especially with brain fog and memory problems, to think that every day totally sucked. Having the journal and looking through it helped remind me on those "2" energy days that I'd had a 5 or a 6 a couple weeks ago, and that I could therefore hope to get back to a 5 or a 6 within a couple weeks.</li><li><strong>Patterns &amp; problem-solving.</strong> The combination of all of those symptoms helped me identify some patterns that had a significant positive impact on my quality of life. Some examples:<ul><li>I always broke out in hive-like rashes within 24-48 hours after eating chicken (but not eggs). I quit eating chicken and have had very few of those outbreaks since.</li><li>My face broke out in a rash after having beer or hard cider. I quit alcohol for a year and that helped, and then was able to slowly test and reintroduce certain kinds of alcohol in moderation.</li><li>I noticed that my fatigue levels were noticeably higher when I a) didn't hydrate enough or take electrolytes, and b) didn't get any physical movement in for 2+ days in a row. These insights have changed how I hydrate and kept me moving even on days where I think I don't have the energy to walk my dog--because I know that the movement, weirdly, seems to help me feel less tired.</li><li>I realized that my cognitive issues were getting worse and worse, which prompted me to reach out to my doctor, who evaluated me for stroke and did a brain MRI. I got a neurologist consult out of this, but ultimately ended up cancelling it because by the time I made it through the waitlist, my cognitive issues had improved significantly.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Scientific method.</strong> Tracking all the things meant that when I read a study suggesting using a particular supplement or trying a behavioral change, I could track how my body did after making those changes. This tied in with the patterns &amp; problem-solving element; I was able to science my own body a bit to eke out small and then larger gains. Some examples:<ul><li>In the first year of LC, I often ran a fever of 100F (once for 40 days straight). I was able to break this streak by adding in a daily Vitamin C dose.</li><li>A friend suggested Reishi tincture to help modulate my immune system, when I thought I was having a "cytokine storm". I took it thinking it might help my shortness of breath. It didn't have much impact on that, but it did seem to help with the fevers and kept my rashes calmer, so I continued taking it for about a year until those symptoms disappeared or became more manageable.</li><li>I tried Vitamin D3 for months to help with cognitive things. I hadn't been doing the best symptom tracking when I began it, and at some point I ran out and decided I wouldn't get more. Three days into that, I realized that my brain fog and cognitive symptoms were noticeably worse--so I went back on it.</li><li>I read about scent therapy and got a variety of essential oils to try to retrain my brain to smell. Thanks to symptom tracking, I could tell that this really didn't do anything for me, so I stopped doing it.</li><li>I discovered that high-aerobic exercise was the worst trigger for my post-exertional malaise, so I was able to focus on less intensive workouts that still gave me movement and helped me connect to my body: walking, Qigong, yoga, breathwork, etc.</li><li>After years on birth control for ovarian cysts and uterine fibroids, I consulted with my doctors and decided to try coming off of the birth control to see if it impacted my symptoms one way or the other. I'm now a year out from that decision and this has been my best year with LC--it does seem like I have slightly more energy off it than on it (which is counter to a lot of women's experiences with LC, go figure!).</li></ul></li></ul><p>The journal was how I got through the first year of LC. I hand-wrote it in composition notebooks and used a visual layout that helped me remember to add the same things every day.</p><p>I largely stopped doing it after I got Covid a second time and was put on Paxlovid--that experience significantly helped a good chunk of my symptoms and I stopped being able to find any new patterns or gains.</p><h4>Phase 2: Visible app</h4><p>A fellow student in a class I took learned I had fatigue issues as part of LC and reached out to me privately in 2022 to say she had Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and had found an app that measured heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and did symptom tracking to be useful.</p><p>I decided to give it a try after reading some of the information on how HR and HRV seem to correlate with fatigue levels.</p><p>The app is called Visible: Long Covid &amp; ME/CFS (available through the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makevisible.visible" title="Visible: Long Covid &amp; ME/CFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/visible-long-covid-me-cfs/id1624474919" title="Visible: Long Covid &amp; ME/CFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple App Store</a>).</p><p>It includes a range of symptoms I was already tracking, and you can add or remove them over time. In the morning, you use the flash/camera on your phone to track your HR and HRV in the morning and log your sleep quality, and at night you log the rest of your symptoms.</p><p>I've been using it for about a year now, and it has proven remarkably effective at telling me each morning how rough my day is going to be, energy-wise. It uses a baseline for your HR, HRV, and the symptoms you choose to track to give you a pacing score of 1 to 5. (I assume it goes to 5...I have only ever gotten as high as 4!). It's been pretty accurate and this is one more tool I use to figure out when it's okay to push myself and when not to.</p><p>It's free to use in the above format. They recently added Visible Plus, a paid subscription feature that includes a wearable heart rate armband; I just joined that but haven't started using the band yet, so I can't say if that additional cost is worthwhile yet.</p><p>But the app has been solid enough and easy enough to use--and my symptoms have stabilized enough overall--so that I no longer do the more detailed journal.</p><h3>2: Reprioritize</h3><p>I've had to brutally, painfully reprioritize my life. Many of the things I used to spend the most time doing (such as working out--I once was a triathlete and a thru-hiker, after all!) are no longer options in the body I have. And I often don't have the energy to do all kinds of things I'd like to do, whether it's driving more than an hour away or hanging out with friends.</p><p>If, like me, you were an otherwise healthy and active person before you got LC, you'll probably have to go through this, too. One of the concepts that might be new to you is that of spoon theory. Here's a quick intro, but there are lots of descriptions and resources out there:</p><p class="align-center"></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7_9Nis6JqLo?si=YlVts-38S-GDk-hD" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><p>That energy rating in my journal and my 1-5 score from Visible both serve as a measure of my spoons. On days where I feel like I have fewer spoons, I adjust my day as much as I can to accommodate that. (And try to do more on the days where I have more.) Spoon theory is a workable concept and an easier way to explain to loved ones how you're struggling. My partner and many close friends will now ask me if I have spoons to do xx or talk about yy now, which is AMAZING.</p><h3>3: Grieve</h3><p>LC can surface A LOT of grief. Grief that is mostly going to be unresolved. Many of us lose the ability to be active, or to think clearly. Many of us can no longer do the same jobs we did before, or work at all--some even qualify for disability. We more than anyone have a life <em>before</em> Covid and a life <em>after</em> Covid, and they are starkly different things. (Many of my posts here are basically my attempts to grieve those changes, to try to get to a place of acceptance.)</p><p>A lot of us are familiar with Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's Five Stages of Grief. In 2015, Jennifer Martin, PsyD, proposed a <a href="https://www.painnewsnetwork.org/stories/2015/9/13/the-7-psychological-stages-of-chronic-pain-illness" title="The 7 Psychological Stages of Chronic Pain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seven-Stage model</a> for those with chronic illness, which includes stages like "Loss of Self and Confusion" and "Re-evaluation of Life, Roles and Goals".</p><p>This one's harder for me to talk about because it feels like no matter how much progress I make at trying to accept where I'm at, I *still* carry the grief of losing a lot of my life. It can be hard, for example, to look at pictures from when I was competing in triathlons or thru-hiking and to reconcile those with a body that considers running errands after working five hours to be "too much".</p><p>It's also the one that seems to be hardest for others to offer support on, because many people in your life will stay firmly stuck in denial that you are forever changed. They want you to be healthy and "back to normal" and often won't be open to discussing the grief that comes with this diagnosis.</p><h3>4: Find support</h3><p>In all of this, the more support you have, the better. But I'll also say: trying to convince your healthy loved ones to acknowledge LC and that it's changed you can be really hard, and can in and of itself take a lot of spoons. Sometimes it's worth finding support in other places, like:</p><ul><li><strong>A local Long Covid clinic or support group:</strong> Before the funding dried up, my local health network had a LC clinic. As part of that clinic, they ran a free drop-in support group that met twice a month. That support group was a lifeline when I needed it most: I was among peers, and though we all had different experiences, we all also "got" how hard things were.</li><li><strong>Therapy:</strong> Yup, you can find a therapist to talk to about these things. Ideally you'll want to look for someone working with folks who have chronic illness, so they have some understanding of where you're coming from.</li><li><strong>Online support groups:</strong> There are a few Facebook groups out there for LC members. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/COVID19survivorcorps/" title="Survivor Corps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Survivor Corps</a> is one. There are also a few groups specific to WHEN you got LC. I'm in a group called Long Haul COVID Fighters - Round 1 (Onset of illness PRIOR to 04/01/20), for example. I imagine there are subreddits and other such resources, too.</li><li><strong>Others in your extended circle:</strong> By being very "out" and vocal about having LC, I've become someone who my extended network reaches out to as they or their loved ones have issues with LC. Sometimes this is tiring to me, but it also allows me to connect with folks around LC and give them the support I never had in the beginning.</li><li><strong>Books: </strong>I'm a reader, so I tend to turn to books to make sense of things I'm struggling with. A sampling of books that I've found helpful:<ul><li>Meghan O'Rourke's <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-invisible-kingdom-reimagining-chronic-illness-meghan-o-rourke/17282876?ean=9780399573309" title="The Invisible Kingdom: Reimagining Chronic Illness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Invisible Kingdom: Reimagining Chronic Illness</a>: Though O'Rourke doesn't have LC, she does have other chronic conditions, and this is a good journey through the Western medical system and its ideas about illness and treatment, chronic illnesses and conditions, and what successfully managing one might look like.</li><li>Tricia Hersey's <a href="https://thenapministry.com/" title="Rest Is Resistance: A Manifesto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rest Is Resistance: A Manifesto</a>: Hersey runs The Nap Ministry and this is a manifesto that was well-timed for me to try to disentangle my own sense of self from being "productive" in capitalist terms. (And no, those weren't things I'd considered before I got sick...see the point about reprioritizing!)</li><li>Arthur W. Frank's <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-wounded-storyteller-body-illness-and-ethics-second-edition-arthur-w-frank/1838?ean=9780226004976" title="The Wounded Storyteller: Body, Illness, and Ethics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wounded Storyteller: Body, Illness, and Ethics</a>: I'd only recommend this one if you're really interested in how narrative impacts how we view the world, and if that's a concept you'd like to explore w/r/t LC. It's not the easiest read, but the major narrative milestones he discusses resonated with me.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Substacks:</strong> If you're of the emailed newsletter persuasion, there are some good Substacks out there. I'm currently following a few, including:<ul><li>Tom Harris' <a href="https://thomasharris.substack.com/" title="The Long Hauler Sunbeam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Long Hauler Sunbeam</a> - a summary of some things in the news plus a little bit of sunshine</li><li>Brandon's <a href="https://longcovidweekly.substack.com/" title="Long Covid Weekly Newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long Covid Weekly Newsletter</a> - weekly summary of news on LC and ME/CFS</li><li>Janna Moen's <a href="https://lcbreakdown.substack.com/" title="Long COVID Research Breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long COVID Research Breakdown</a> - a bit heavier/more scientific, but she does a great job digging into stuff</li></ul></li></ul><h2>That's all...for now</h2><p>I'm still trying to figure out what resources or guidance may be most useful for newcomers to the LC realm. If you've found your way here that way, please <a href="mailto:hikingwithsass@gmail.com" title="contact me" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">reach out</a> and let me know what else I can share.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on December 11, 2023</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/tags/longhaulerwithsass/">longhaulerwithsass</a></li></ul>false<div class="post__bio bio"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f5fcd999b9945615c753696fda93bdc?s&#x3D;240" loading="lazy" height="240" width="240" class="bio__avatar" alt="Kate / Sassafras"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/authors/kate/" rel="author">Kate / Sassafras</a></h3><div class="bio__desc">Hi, I'm Kate, trail name Sassafras.
