It's therefore one of the things I wish I could explain well.</p><p>So back when I was in my early twenties, I was getting a Master's in Writing. I wrote all kinds of things, though I preferred poetry and short fiction. At least three separate times over the course of about a year and a half, I tried to write a poem about Ella Fitzgerald. It never came out right.</p><p>Then I studied poetry with Allison Adelle Hedge Coke. Allison pushed me and my writing in ways I hadn't been before, shoving me outside of the comfort zone of the more narrative/intellectual poems I'd been writing and into something a bit more freeform.</p><p>Of course I resisted that. I think every student has to, for a while.</p><p>But then one day partway through the semester, I suddenly got a first line about Ella Fitzgerald. And when I wrote it down, an entire poem came tumbling out. A poem totally unlike anything else I had ever written. It leaped through parts of my life, half-forgotten things, made some bold statements, and in so many ways felt like a fitting ode to scat and jazz.</p><p>I really can't stress how much of a break from my "usual" work this was. For me, it was more visceral, less linear, pulling together seemingly totally disparate threads from my own life. In many ways, it didn't feel like it came from me, but from somewhere else, like I was just a conduit for something the universe wanted to say.</p><p>I took it to class full of energy, and while not all of it made sense to my classmates, I got generally positive feedback on it. I made a few tweaks.</p><p>And when I went to perform it at our monthly community open mic, I tried something I had never done with any of my other poems: I memorized it and performed it from memory, no scrap of paper or notes in sight.</p><p>That process of memorizing each line prompted some small wording tweaks because there were just ways that the words fit together in my memory that were different from what I had on the page. I can still remember standing in my grad assistant office with its cream cinder block walls, reciting it over and over again aloud after everyone else had gone home for the day, making small adjustments, laughing at myself when I kept forgetting the same lines.</p><p>From that moment on, the poem became a part of me. I recited it at that open mic, and again from my memory when I gave my public thesis reading.</p><p>But for me, it transcended literary gatherings. I would recite it to myself when I was sad or depressed or angry. Similar to how some people use the Lord's Prayer, I think--it was a series of words that grounded me, calmed me, reminded me there was a much bigger world than my present moment and that I was connected to that world. I would often recite it while I was out hiking, because something about it felt so joyfully present.</p><p>But I often used it in the most stressful moments:</p><ul><li>Almost a decade later, I was traveling in Europe and ended up touring Dachau on my thirtieth birthday. I was getting a different degree this time, on a school trip, but I had a hard time getting back on the tour bus. I wanted to cry and rage and scream; I didn't understand how inhuman and inhumane humans can be. (I still don't understand this.) I sat in a row of bus seats by myself and quietly whispered this poem to myself, through tears.</li><li>A year later, in the midst of my divorce, I took endless walks to calm my mind, and I got into meditation. I would recite the poem repeatedly on walks, and I often said it when I settled down to meditate, as a way to clear my mind and set an open intention.</li><li>My mom died the day before I started my move from Washington, DC, to Maine. And on the first day of the move, so many things went wrong. I'd scheduled movers to help me load up my moving truck and reserved my building's loading dock, but when I picked up the truck and got to the dock, a utility vehicle blocked the dock. My movers were there, already on the clock, and I had to track down a front desk worker who could track down the electrician to get him to move his car, which delayed everything by almost 45 minutes. Then once everything was packed and loaded, I went back to the moving truck location to have them hook up the trailer for my car and get my car loaded, and none of the staff there seemed to know how to hook the car up. In the end, instead of leaving DC around 1pm, I left at the start of evening rush hour. I then had to drive through a Noreaster (because of course I did), and almost got blown off the Delaware Memorial Bridge. I kept reciting the poem aloud, trying to stay awake and together enough to get through the drive.</li><li>And when I was thru-hiking and my mind had exhausted every other thing it could think of to occupy itself, I would often recite it to myself or aloud as I hiked, timing the rhythm of the words to my footsteps.</li></ul><p>Which is to say: I could call upon this poem at any moment, often under extreme emotional or physical duress, and it was always there. I could feel the shape of the stanzas, I knew all the pauses, I long ago stopped having to think about the words and just had them come tumbling out.</p><p>So, fast forward a bit, to a random Friday night in November 2022. I was, by this point, a good two and a half years into long Covid. I felt I was managing really well--my fatigue wasn't totally debilitating, I'd figured out how to manage my energy better so I mostly wasn't having huge flares in symptoms, and most people I interacted with had no idea that I'd been through anything so hard.</p><p>I was driving home from buying groceries on a day that had felt somewhat stressful, and as had been happening a lot, my mind circled the stress of still not being able to buy a house. A lot of my stress in 2021, 2022, and 2023 has been from this--my landlord has raised our rent and periodically threatens to sell our house; I want to buy a house so I have stability, a yard for my dog, a garden for myself, and to have some control over expensive things like furnaces and hot water heaters.</p><p>For whatever reason, driving home this night, I was near tears.</p><p>And to calm myself, I started stuttering out the poem. It's an ancient comfort now, nearly 20 years old.</p><p>And I couldn't make it through the end of the first stanza.</p><p>It just wasn't there, in my head, anymore.</p><p>The whole comforting shape and feel of the poem, of words that I had thought permanently etched into my psyche...it was gone.</p><p>I tried to save it, to skip the end of the first stanza, to jump into a place I could remember further down, which helped me re-remember part of the first stanza, but then I forgot the next stanza's transition and the entire ending.</p><p>But "forgot" isn't the right word. I didn't forget it. There was just nothing where it normally was, a gaping hole that I was flailing around in, trying to find something to hold onto.</p><p>It was as if someone had slapped me, or dropped me into a pool of ice. The shock--and the horror--of it being gone...it's the creative thing I'm the proudest of having written, and it had become a kind of mantra through thick and thin, a kind of prayer against the dark and the horror. A thing that was so much a part of me that I could remember it in extreme stress, and yet here I was, on a fairly normal Friday night, and I was clutching at tiny fragments of it instead.</p><p>I did fully start crying at that point. Somehow I didn't drive off the road. Somehow.</p><p>As a long-ago graduation present, two dear friends printed a lovely version of my poem as a small poster, with a photo of Ella Fitzgerald. I framed it and it hangs in my entryway.</p><p>When I got home, I reread it.</p><p>The words were there, and that was some comfort, but the <em>feel</em> of the poem's shape was gone. I could recognize the words as things I'd written, and parts of them conjured feelings for me, but that deeply ingrained feeling that had been a part of me since I had first memorized it...that was gone.</p><p>I don't know if anyone who's not inside my head can understand how brutal this loss was. But this is exactly what long Covid brain fog is. It takes things you know inside and out, extremely well...and then it hides them, makes them feel foreign and unfamiliar when you least expect it.</p><p>Today, writing this, I just closed my eyes and recited the poem, albeit somewhat haltingly. Most of it is here, now. But I don't trust it. It feels like I am forgetting something important, like I should go check the text to be sure.</p><p>This is what this illness does to you. Even when you are doing "well", it's a tenuous and fragile wellness, and it takes so little to make you doubt that perceived wellness.</p><p>So please, if you are an otherwise healthy person, please don't think that forgetting to do a task at work, or forgetting to buy eggs when you're at the store, is comparable to the brain fog those of us with chronic illnesses have. If you haven't felt like a core memory or piece of you has gone missing on a dark and miserable night and might never find its way home, then it's not brain fog.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on 7 April 2023</p><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__tag"><h3>Tagged in:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/tags/longhaulerwithsass/">longhaulerwithsass</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livewithsass.com%2Fon-brain-fog%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook-f" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livewithsass.com%2Fon-brain-fog%2F&amp;via=Live%20with%20Sass&amp;text=On%20brain%20fog%3A%20I%20never%20had%20to%20dream%20a%20paper%20moon" class="js-share icon brands fa-twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livewithsass.com%2Fon-brain-fog%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></div></div></div><div class="post__bio"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f5fcd999b9945615c753696fda93bdc?s&#x3D;240" loading="lazy" alt="Kate / Sassafras"><div><h3><a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/authors/kate/" class="invert" rel="author">Kate / Sassafras</a></h3><p>Hi, I&#x27;m Kate, trail name Sassafras.
