It gave me a word to describe something I'd intuitively been doing already, and that word allowed me to get more information on how to do it more formally.</p><p>First, to start: no, it's not this kind of pacing:</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/2uwZ4xi75JhxZYeyQB/giphy.gif" alt="Looney Tunes gif of Sylvester pacing back and forth" width="480" height="360" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><p>Pacing within the context of chronic fatigue is more like the adage to "Pace yourself; it's a marathon, not a sprint." It's about spacing out your activities during the day or week so that you don't push your body too far (which can cause symptom flares or crashes).</p><p>At its core, it's about alternating between periods of activity and periods of rest--whether that's within a single day or across multiple days--and splitting tasks into smaller chunks so that they take less energy.</p><p>Pacing with a chronic illness isn't just a marathon; it's like waking up each day and having to run anywhere from a 5k to a 50k, with no rest days, no way to opt out, and very little input in the distance or terrain type you have to clear. Your body is both the race course and the equipment, and sometimes it will turn on itself.</p><p>I have a love-hate relationship with pacing. On the one hand, when I do it well, my quality of life and my daily baseline is way better. On the other hand, there are days when I wish I could just throw it out the window and do whatever I feel like. (I do, sometimes...and pay the consequence later.)</p><p>Here are four strategies for increasing your success with Long Covid (LC) pacing:</p><h2>1: Mind your energy</h2><p>One of the things it was hardest for me to wrap my head around in the beginning is that pacing is about energy usage <em>that is not necessarily physical</em>. As a former endurance athlete and thru-hiker, I was used to pushing my body hard and using a lot of physical energy--and then having to recover from that.</p><p>But I was far less familiar with the ways that <em>mental energy</em> and <em>emotional energy</em> could be depleting. In fact, these two forms of energy are <strong>far more</strong> draining for me than physical exertion.</p><p>I use the Visible: Long Covid &amp; ME/CFS app (available through the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.makevisible.visible" title="Visible: Long Covid &amp; ME/CFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Store</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/visible-long-covid-me-cfs/id1624474919" title="Visible: Long Covid &amp; ME/CFS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple App Store</a>) to track my symptoms and energy use. The app gives me an option to rank my emotional, mental, and physical exertion (None, A little, Somewhat, A lot).</p><p>It wasn't until I started using this app that I really consciously thought about mental and emotional exertion in the same class as physical. That little prompt at the end of each day has helped me become a lot more aware of where and how I'm using my energy. Whether you use the app or not, consider tracking your exertion on all three fronts to help manage LC.</p><p>For me, the most stressful forms of energy use are:</p><ul><li><strong>Prolonged periods of focus or concentration</strong>: These have gotten easier for me in the last year, but only with things that I want to be focused on. If it's something I'm not interested in or don't want to do, the energy it takes to focus is downright debilitating.</li><li><strong>Long or repeated conversations</strong>: I currently work 100% remotely, but the days where I have meetings tend to drain me. Over an hour of meetings completely destroys my energy for the rest of the day. Longer phone and in-person conversations are also draining, though phone is less so, probably because I'm not having to visually focus on anything while I talk.</li><li><strong>Emotional stress</strong>: This is the single most draining activity I can do. If I get upset about something enough to cry, for example, the next day is almost always guaranteed to be a crash. It's a similar response if I get angry or upset.</li></ul><p>This is one of the weird mixed blessings/curses of LC: you become far more aware of the ways that you use energy, and if you work at pacing at all, you also become far more intentional and deliberate about how you spend your energy.</p><h2>2: Redefine rest</h2><p>Before I got LC, "rest" often included things like reading, listening to music, playing an instrument, or watching a movie.</p><p>With LC, many of these tasks are no longer especially restful to me. Most of them require a level of concentration that can be quite taxing.</p><p>For me, rest has evolved to be things like:</p><ul><li>Sitting and staring out the window</li><li>Really simple craft activities, like drawing or coloring</li><li>Listening to certain kinds of music (lo-fi, thank you for existing!)</li><li>Reading certain kinds of things: My monthly community paper and airport-style books like murder mysteries or YA fiction are restful; nonfiction or more serious literary fiction is not</li><li>Sitting and sipping a hot beverage and doing nothing else</li><li>Watching very specific YouTube content that either doesn't involve anyone talking or involves voices I find soothing</li><li>Guided meditation or visualization exercises</li><li>Meditation</li><li>Breathwork, especially box breathing</li><li>Silence. Just...silence: I could sit and stare at the wall and as long as it's quiet, I would find it restful.</li><li>Massages: I have a great massage therapist who I see about once a month now. That time/space is quite sacred (and she treats it as such, too, which helps!).</li></ul><p>Find what actually feels restful for you and try to integrate that in to periods of your day.</p><h2>3: Divide to conquer</h2><p>One of the big quality of life changes I've made is that I used to tackle a project in one or two long, focused sessions. And I use the term project here fairly loosely. It can include things like cleaning or a little building project or, for example, putting up holiday decorations.</p><p>As part of pacing, I generally do not even attempt to complete a project in a single long session. I break it into much smaller pieces and do it that way. This generally allows me to still get the project completed while not causing me to lose entire days to a crash from overdoing it.</p><p>Here are a couple examples of what that looks like for me:</p><ul><li><strong>Cleaning</strong>: Aside from things that have to be done regularly (like dishes, or laundry), my cleaning gets spread out over several weekends. One weekend, I might sweep and mop the floors. Another weekend, I might clean my bathroom. Another weekend, I might tidy my bedroom. Doing all of this in one day would definitely cause a crash. Splitting it up generally allows me to avoid crashes.</li><li><strong>Building</strong>: I like to design and build furniture. In the past, I would design and purchase supplies on one day, and then spend the next 1-2 days cutting, assembling, sanding, and finishing a project. Now, I design over the course of a few days. I purchase supplies on a separate day. I do all my preliminary measuring and cutting in one or two sessions on another day. Assembling might be spread out over multiple days, as will sanding and other finishing work. This can mean a project that would have taken me a single weekend before can take me over a month of weekends now.</li></ul><p>In the beginning, this was wildly frustrating to me.</p><p>As time has gone by, I've realized that this form of tackling things both works much better for me, but also allows me to maintain a better level of focus at each stage of the game. I'm not rushing through anything, and it's often very deliberate. (And I am definitely more of a measure twice and cut once person now than I was before!)</p><p>The cadence of my life is very different now. The pressure of a deadline will often prompt me to throw all ideas of pacing out the window, much to my own detriment. So I've had to remove deadlines for my own things as much as possible, and I take on fewer commitments for others that involve hard deadlines, unless they're so far out in the future that I can still break things down and tackle them bit by bit.</p><h2>4: Scale it down a bit</h2><p>Eddie Izzard's fantastic Dress to Kill stand-up has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGGeLHnDQk8" title="Eddie Izzard - Career Adviser &amp; Smoking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this short segment</a> where he talks about meeting with the career advisor as a kid. The career advisor asks him what he wants to be and he says he wants to be an astronaut. And the advisor responds: "Well, you're British, so scale it down a bit." This repeats a couple times as Izzard gradually picks less and less challenging careers.</p><p>This is basically my advice for learning how to pace with LC:</p><blockquote><p>Well, you have Long Covid, so scale it down a bit.</p></blockquote><p>When you first start out trying to pace, take whatever you think you can do in a day. Now remove 50% of what you thought you could do. Try that. (You may have to go even lower, depending on how severe your symptoms are.)</p><p>You can keep playing around until you find a percentage that works. Do that until you start to reset the internal barometer of what feels "doable" in a day. (And if you get overenthusiastic in your pacing in the future, repeat this.)</p><h2>Two flavors of pacing "failure"</h2><p>In listening to other longhaulers and observing myself, it feels like there are generally two ways we might "fail" at pacing:</p><ol><li>By doing too much on our "good" days, causing a precipitous crash in the following day(s).</li><li>By doing too much on our "bad" days, whether to distract ourselves from what's going on or because we have no choice, therefore causing a prolonged crash.</li></ol><p>I have been guilty of both.</p><p>In my first couple years with LC, the first one was more common: any time I had a good day, I would try to do the amount or intensity of things I did when I was "healthy", which inevitably caused a crash like a rubberband being overstretched and snapping back.</p><p>In the last year and a half, I fall more into the second camp. I have a better intuitive understanding of how far I can push myself on good days and what the resulting crash will feel like (and how to manage that).</p><p>But when I'm having a bad day, I often don't have the luxury of doing nothing. Or I do things because they help distract me from how bad of a day I'm having. I can't quite express this well--it's as if I take this attitude of "well, since I can't do the stuff I want to do, I don't just want to lie here in a state of misery, so how I about I do this one small thing and then I'll rest" which leads to ten small things.</p><p>This raises one final important point: your pacing, like your LC symptoms, will be highly individualistic. There's some great general guidance out there, but at the end of the day, it's still about trial and error with your body and your mind to find what works for you. My pacing may look nothing like yours, but if it works for your body, it's right for you.</p><h2>Additional resources</h2><p>There are a lot of good resources on pacing out there, most of which you can find by searching for "chronic illness pacing". (I suggest chronic illness since there's a lot more resources on pacing for ME/CFS or generic chronic illness than LC specifically.)</p><p>A few that I've found useful:</p><ul><li>Toni Bernhard's blog post on Psychology Today (though it's 7 years old at this point, the tips are still relevant): <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/turning-straw-gold/201606/pacing-the-chronically-ill-person-s-best-friend" title="Pacing: The Chronically Ill Person's Best Friend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pacing: The Chronically Ill Person's Best Friend</a></li><li>The Ehlers-Danlos Support UK's guide to <a href="https://ehlers-danlos.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pacing-for-people-with-me-booklet.pdf" title="Pacing for people with M.E." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pacing for people with M.E.</a> This is geared toward those with ME/CFS, but most of the insights hold true for those with Long Covid fatigue, too.</li></ul><p>Have a strategy not listed here, or a pacing question you'd like my input on? <a href="mailto:hikingwithsass@gmail.com" title="Contact Sass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drop me a line</a> and let me know!</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on December 15, 2023</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/tags/longhaulerwithsass/">longhaulerwithsass</a></li></ul>false<div class="post__bio bio"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f5fcd999b9945615c753696fda93bdc?s&#x3D;240" loading="lazy" height="240" width="240" class="bio__avatar" alt="Kate / Sassafras"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://www.livewithsass.com/authors/kate/" rel="author">Kate / Sassafras</a></h3><div class="bio__desc">Hi, I'm Kate, trail name Sassafras.
