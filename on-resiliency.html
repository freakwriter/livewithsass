It's taking a story that has some seriously negative turns to it and viewing it in a positive way.</p><p>I'm not talking about forced or toxic positivity. This isn't let's pretend it's all sunshine and roses.</p><p>It is, instead, to focus on a core thread in the story itself.</p><p>For me, that thread is resiliency.</p><p>I have to thank Amy, the long Covid therapist I saw, for this word. It has a lot of power. ðŸ™Œ</p><p class="dropcap">One of the things I've found hardest about having long Covid is that a lot of very well-intentioned, well-meaning people spent weeks and months telling me that I'd "get back to where I was before in no time." We've probably all said something like this to a friend going through a break-up, a job change, or other tough times, and it's meant as a reassurance, a way of saying: hey, I know it sucks right now, but this is abnormal and you'll get back to normal soon enough. Chin up.</p><p>But there are times that this is the complete opposite of reassuring.</p><p>First of all, it assumes that the "normal" state of life for most of us is one of stability and a fixed, defined identity. That's patently false.</p><p>"Normal" life is a rollercoaster. Things are always falling apart and coming back together, then falling apart again. Stuff breaks. We get stressed, we get anxious, we get depressed.</p><p>Trying to define "normal" as somehow absent of those things has this implicit effect of making us feel bad for not being "normal". And if your situation is turning out to be more chronic and long-lasting--like long Covid, for example--it makes you feel like you will never be "normal" again. No bueno.</p><p>Thru-hikers often intuitively pick up on this. The trail gives you endless ups and downs, every day. You might score a beautiful camping spot only to have it downpour for the next four days, and you're putting on still soaking wet socks and shirt. You might push hard to get to a summit that's supposed to have gorgeous views just to have it walled in with fog. You might get an amazing care package full of love and good food from friends but it weighs more than the rest of your pack combined. Or the trail you're supposed to be hiking might look like this:</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.livewithsass.com/media/posts/3/IMG_20180623_102309-2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="http://www.livewithsass.com/media/posts/3/responsive/IMG_20180623_102309-2-xs.jpg 300w, http://www.livewithsass.com/media/posts/3/responsive/IMG_20180623_102309-2-sm.jpg 480w, http://www.livewithsass.com/media/posts/3/responsive/IMG_20180623_102309-2-md.jpg 768w, http://www.livewithsass.com/media/posts/3/responsive/IMG_20180623_102309-2-lg.jpg 1024w, http://www.livewithsass.com/media/posts/3/responsive/IMG_20180623_102309-2-xl.jpg 1360w, http://www.livewithsass.com/media/posts/3/responsive/IMG_20180623_102309-2-2xl.jpg 1600w" alt="A steep uphill sloped covered in a jumble of rocks. In the distance at the top of the hill, a tree with AT white trail blazes indicates the rock jumble IS the trail." width="3036" height="4048"><figcaption>No, this is not a random jumble of rocks. See the trail blaze at the very top? It's the trail. :)</figcaption></figure><p class="dropcap">But more than this false measure of "normal", the entire piece of advice strips you of the story of overcoming difficulties. Of being resilient.</p><p>When friends or family told me I'd get back to normal before I knew it, or back to where I'd been health- or fitness-wise, my response changed over time.</p><p>In the first few days and weeks, it was a kind of reassurance. This was temporary, and the reassurance felt good.</p><p>But as this dragged on to months and then years, it seemed flat and full of denial.</p><p>And eventually, it felt gross to me because the fact was: I'd been through a lot of shit <em>and I wanted to celebrate that, own it, and have people recognize it.</em></p><p>Let's be real: it's really shitty to have long Covid. It's weeks and months of riding a rollercoaster of exhaustion and fatigue, where it takes every ounce of will-power you might have just to get out of bed and do even simple things. The brain fog can be mild (taking a split-second longer to remember a thing) or thick and heavy (forgetting names of people, forgetting major emotional events just days after they happen).</p><p>I still have very little sense of smell or taste two years in. I've had random allergic skin reactions to a range of foods I used to eat regularly. I have persistent tinnitus in one ear and hypersensitive hearing the rest of the time. Each day is like a roulette wheel of symptoms, and though my daily baseline has improved with time, it's still a roulette wheel. The consequences are just a bit more expected and predictable now than they were in 2020.</p><p>When you tell me I'll be back where I was, you basically erase all of that struggle because you don't acknowledge it. You sweep it under the rug as a "temporary" thing. I'm two years in. This isn't temporary. This is my new normal. And it's a really hard normal.</p><p class="dropcap">Quite frankly: it's the biggest endurance effort I've ever undertaken. Way harder than thru-hiking, which I could choose to quit at any time. I don't get to opt out of this reality. There are no zero days, no trail magic, no quitting and going home. Like Groundhog Day, I wake up to this same reality no matter what I do.</p><p>I'm not saying all of that so that you'll have sympathy or pity for me.</p><p>I'm saying it because: I'm resilient. I continue to live in this shifting roulette, and I do it reasonably gracefully. Most people have no idea how rough my day to day life is. I'm still working, still walking my dog, still cooking even if I can't properly taste what I make. I have some dreams and some hopes now, too, which was unthinkable a year ago.</p><p>I'm a resilient warrior. I've been through so much, and continue to go through so much.</p><p>So don't tell me I'll get back to being who I used to be. That woman is long gone. The woman I am now is much wiser even if her brain doesn't work as well. She's gentler, more thoughtful, generally a better listener. She thinks more from her heart than her head. She considers that people bring all kinds of baggage to each interaction that might not be remotely visible.</p><p>She's a kinder person, even if she has way less energy.</p><p>And I want you to see her and know that She. Is. Me. Not that picture you have of me from 2.5 years ago. Messy, exhausted, fatigued me, now. And I'll continue to grow and change as I keep living with this condition. I'll keep being in turns angry and disappointed in medical science for not being able to help me, and I'll keep trying to figure out ways to help myself.</p><p class="dropcap">In so many ways, all of us--every single damn one of us--need to drop this story of stability being "normal" and this other stuff being a detour or a distraction. It's neither. Life is always this mixture of more stable and less stable things, of pleasure and pain, of mountain summits and grueling rough terrain. If there's one thing I wish I could tell my pre-long-Covid self, it's that: stop thinking it's supposed to be great all the time and you're somehow messing up if it's not. It's supposed to be a grab bag, and the people who are living with sass are rolling with whatever comes out of that bag, every day.</p><p>Don't try to get back to some previously stable/amazing point in your life--recognize that you're a more amazing person now having gone through all that stuff and continuing to go through and still getting up and living your life anyway.</p><p>Find your resilient story. I promise you, it's in there. You've overcome a lot, and you'll overcoming a lot, and THAT is the story of your life.Â </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 1, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="http://www.livewithsass.com/tags/longhaulerwithsass/">longhaulerwithsass</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f5fcd999b9945615c753696fda93bdc?s&#x3D;240" loading="lazy" alt="Kate / Sassafras"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="http://www.livewithsass.com/authors/kate/" class="invert" rel="author">Kate / Sassafras</a></h3><p>Hi, I&#x27;m Kate Mueller, trail name Sassafras.
