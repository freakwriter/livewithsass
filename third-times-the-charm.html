At all.</p><p>Since then, I've been paying attention and I'm back to where I was about a year ago, with limited sense of taste and reduced sense of smell.</p><p>When I mention this to most overall healthy people, they immediately ask me what I think caused it. Sometimes I answer this question by running through a list of vaguely logical options:</p><ul><li>About 4 weeks ago, I completed a 5k doing 60-second run-walk intervals. It was cold and my body hated it, my heart rate was higher than it had been for my training. The cold stressed my body and I almost puked by the end of the race. Maybe this had long-term repercussions.</li><li>About 2 weeks ago, I got a flu shot. I was quite sick the day after, mildly okay two days after, and then quite sick again the day after that. I've been tired since then, back to the land of "can't get enough sleep". Maybe the flu shot was a bad idea (did it trigger a disproportionate inflammatory response in my immune system?). Or getting it "so soon" after the 5k was too much. Or maybe it's nothing.</li><li>It's actually winter now. My body seems to hate the cold, so it could just be the fact of winter itself causing issues, somehow.</li><li>It's actually winter now, so our forced air furnace is running. My body doesn't seem to like the HVAC system in our rental, so maybe that's triggering it. Or, in tandem with the cold. Or, in tandem with any of the other bullet points listed above.</li></ul><p>But what I really want to say to them is: I have a long Covid body. 1 + 1 stopped adding up to 2 in my body 2.5+ years ago. There doesn't have to be a reason. Sometimes you just hit a point of stress that causes a flare of symptoms, and it's hard to say exactly what it is.</p><p>All I can do at this point is to try to remove stressors, get lots of rest, and hope.</p><p>Though there are things I don't tell them.</p><p>I don't tell them that the night I ate that curry, I went into the bathroom to take my shower and sobbed through my whole shower.</p><p>Because you think you've found a way to manage your illness, you think it kind of makes sense and now you can make things livable. And then something that you worked really hard to regain disappears again, just like that, and you're reminded not only that none of it is within your control, not only that the doctors still can't do diddly squat to help you, but also that every time you lose it, you're going to be full of grief. There is no "normal", anymore. There's a baseline that you try to maintain and some days are great and some are still really shitty. And you're not really sure how you managed to get good days for a while once the bad ones return.</p><p>I also don't tell them that when I voiced fear about the 5k or the flu shot tipping my body over the edge, they told me I shouldn't live my life in fear and to just do it. What I want to scream at them is that this isn't irrational fear: given the data I have to work with, it is completely legitimate, warranted fear. The idea that I might have somehow brought this on myself by these "risky" actions--actions which most everyone else didn't consider risky at all--is so sour I want to spit it out of my mouth. (Or it would be, if I could taste sour things.)</p><p>I cried, but I also wanted to scream. I wanted to rage around the house and break things, and just...lash out with all of it. I didn't. I sobbed in the shower and went to bed. Then I managed to tell my whole team at work that I'm sicker again and will need some grace and flexibility; please don't schedule back-to-back meetings with me for hours on end. And I started testing what I can and can't taste and smell. The losses aren't as bad as 2020 and 2021's were, I still have a few flavors I can taste that aren't salt or hot sauce, and a few smells that aren't burning things and dog farts (which were the two smells I could smell for all of 2020 and a good chunk of 2021).</p><p>But if there's all this stuff I won't say to most people, why write about it here?</p><p>Well, the first reason is simple: I need to speak this out so it doesn't just fester in my body and turn me bitter and rageful. Venting some steam.</p><p>But also: somewhere out there, I imagine there's another spoonie who's also going through a recurring loss of a good baseline. And that loss slapped them in the face, took their breath away, and left them sobbing and confused and lonely and angry and sad all at once. Whatever that loss was, it probably seemed small to outsiders (aren't you used to this by now?) and yet it feels huge and overwhelming and how on earth does any of us go on living.</p><p>So you, random chronically ill person I don't actually know: I'm writing this for you. You're not alone. That rage and grief and confusion you're feeling? It's totally normal for your situation. There are lots of us who go through the same things. I'm here to write a little of it down so that we can both recognize that the emperor has no f*cking clothes on and maybe laugh or cry a bit about how absurd it is that no one else notices.</p><p>Also, if your sense of taste and smell still work, please go eat some curry and revel in what an amazing thing those senses are. Lean your face over the bowl or plate, close your eyes, and inhale deeply and just f*cking luxuriate in it. Take a couple bites and let them sit in your mouth a little longer so you can get the full wave of different flavors. And then send me a single thought of flare recovery vibes. ðŸ™ƒ</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on December 16, 2022</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="http://www.livewithsass.com/tags/longhaulerwithsass/">longhaulerwithsass</a></li></ul>false<div class="post__bio bio"><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f5fcd999b9945615c753696fda93bdc?s&#x3D;240" loading="lazy" height="240" width="240" class="bio__avatar" alt="Kate / Sassafras"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="http://www.livewithsass.com/authors/kate/" rel="author">Kate / Sassafras</a></h3><div class="bio__desc">Hi, I'm Kate, trail name Sassafras.
